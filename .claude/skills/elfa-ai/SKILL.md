# Elfa API Skill

This skill enables agents to work with the [Elfa API](https://api.elfa.ai) — a social listening,
market context layer, and automated condition engine for crypto. Elfa ingests real-time data
from Twitter/X, Telegram, and other sources, then structures sentiment, narratives, and
attention shifts into actionable trading insights. The **Market Intelligence** endpoints cover
measurement (counts, engagement, accounts) and interpretation (chat, summaries, narratives).
The **Auto** subsystem adds a managed condition engine and trigger pipeline — describe what to
watch for, and Auto evaluates continuously and fires actions when conditions are met.

Full documentation: [docs.elfa.ai](https://docs.elfa.ai)

## Environment and credentials

Elfa supports API-key auth and x402 keyless payments. API keys are optional when using x402.

| Variable | Required | Use |
|---|---:|---|
| `ELFA_API_KEY` | No | API-key authenticated requests. Start a pay-as-you-go balance at <https://go.elfa.ai/claude-skills>. |
| `ELFA_AGENT_SECRET` | No | Persistent agent identity secret for x402 Auto. Generate once with `openssl rand -hex 32` and reuse for query lifecycle calls. |

> **Do not reuse this as your webhook signing secret.** `webhook.params.signingSecret` is a
> *separate* per-webhook secret that verifies deliveries **from** Elfa **to** your server. See
> [Webhook signature verification](#webhook-signature-verification).

x402 wallet signing is handled client-side by `@x402/fetch` or `@x402/axios`.

## When to use this skill

- User asks about **trending tokens, narratives, or contract addresses** in crypto
- User wants **social mentions** for a specific ticker or keyword
- User wants **smart stats** (smart followers, engagement) for a Twitter/X account
- User wants an **AI-generated market summary, macro overview, or token analysis** — including
  **streaming** chat output
- User wants **structured market events** with impact scores
- User asks how to **integrate, call, or use the Elfa API**
- User wants **code examples** (curl, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript) for Elfa endpoints
- User mentions "elfa" in a crypto or trading data context
- User wants to **set up automated alerts or monitoring** on price, indicators, or narratives
- User wants to **build condition-based triggers** (e.g., "alert me when BTC crosses 100k")
- User wants to **watch the X follow graph** — who followed a tracked account, who it started
  following, or several tracked accounts converging on the same account
- User mentions **Auto**, **EQL**, **condition engine**, or **trigger pipeline** in a crypto context
- User wants **agent workflows** that react to market conditions automatically
- User wants to **build queries with Builder Chat** using natural language

## API Overview

**Base URL:** `https://api.elfa.ai`
**Version:** v2 (current)
**Docs:** [docs.elfa.ai](https://docs.elfa.ai)

### Two access modes

Elfa supports two independent ways to authenticate requests:

| Mode | Endpoint prefix | Auth header | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **API key** | `/v2/` | `x-elfa-api-key: YOUR_KEY` | Humans & apps with a registered key |
| **x402 (keyless)** | `/x402/v2/` | `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <signed-payload>` | Agents & wallets — no signup needed |

Both modes access the same data. The only difference is how you authenticate:
- **API key** — register at https://go.elfa.ai/claude-skills. Start on **pay-as-you-go**: the
  free tier is being phased out, so new integrations should top up a PAYG balance rather than
  build against free credits.
- **x402** — pay per request with USDC on Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, or Solana. No
  registration, no API key. Currently in beta.

### Endpoints at a glance

#### Data endpoints

All endpoints below work with both `/v2/` (API key) and `/x402/v2/` (keyless) prefixes,
except `key-status` which is API key mode only.

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Credits |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v2/ping` | GET | Health check — **no auth required** (API key mode only) | Free |
| `/v2/key-status` | GET | API key usage & limits (API key only) | Free |
| `/v2/aggregations/trending-tokens` | GET | Trending tokens by mention count | 1 |
| `/v2/account/smart-stats` | GET | Smart follower & engagement stats — **legacy, will be removed 28 Oct 2026** | 1 |
| `/v2/data/top-mentions` | GET | Top mentions for a ticker symbol | 1 |
| `/v2/data/keyword-mentions` | GET | Search mentions by keywords or account | 1 |
| `/v2/data/event-summary` | GET | AI event summaries from keyword mentions | 5 |
| `/v2/data/trending-narratives` | GET | Trending narrative clusters (Grow+ / PAYG) | 5 |
| `/v2/data/token-news` | GET | Token-related news mentions (tweet source only) | 1 |
| `/v2/data/market-events` | GET | Impact-scored market events (Enterprise only) | Enterprise |
| `/v2/aggregations/trending-cas/twitter` | GET | Trending contract addresses (Twitter) | 1 |
| `/v2/aggregations/trending-cas/telegram` | GET | Trending contract addresses (Telegram) | 1 |
| `/v2/chat` | POST | AI chat, complete JSON response (Grow+ / PAYG) | Speed-based |

`/v2/ping`, `/v2/key-status`, `/v2/chat/stream`, and `/v2/data/market-events` are **API-key
mode only** — they have no `/x402/v2/` counterpart.

#### Auto endpoints (Condition Engine)

Auto endpoints are available under `/v2/auto/` (API key) and
`/x402/v2/auto/` (keyless). See [Auto docs](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/overview) for full details.

> **Auth column legend (tables below).** `API key` = `x-elfa-api-key` only.

**API key mode (`/v2/auto/*`):**

_Query lifecycle:_

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v2/auto/chat` | POST | Builder Chat — AI-assisted query building (produces drafts only) | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/validate` | POST | Validate EQL and preview cost | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries` | POST | Create and activate a query | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries` | GET | List queries | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/:queryId` | GET | Poll query status and executions (resolves query or draft) | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/cancel` | POST | Cancel an `active` query (returns `409` if status is terminal) | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/:queryId` | DELETE | Delete a terminal query — only when status is `triggered` / `expired` / `cancelled` / `failed` (returns `409` otherwise; active queries must be cancelled first) | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/stream` | GET | Stream notifications for **all** your queries on one connection (API-key only — not agent/x402) | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/stream` | GET | Stream notifications for a single query via SSE | API key |

_Query drafts (editable, not yet active):_

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v2/auto/queries/drafts` | POST | Create or update (upsert) a query draft | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/drafts` | GET | List editable query drafts | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId` | GET | Get a specific draft (legacy — prefer `GET /queries/{queryId}`) | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId` | DELETE | Delete a query draft | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId/validate` | POST | Validate a stored draft | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId/convert` | POST | Convert a draft into an active query | API key |

_LLM sessions (for `action.type: "llm"` queries):_

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/sessions` | GET | List LLM sessions | API key |
| `/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/sessions/:sessionId` | GET | Get full LLM session details | API key |

_Executions (trigger fire records):_

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v2/auto/executions` | GET | List execution records | API key |
| `/v2/auto/executions/:executionId` | GET | Get a single execution record | API key |

_Other:_

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/v2/auto/validate-symbol/:exchange/:symbol` | GET | Check whether a symbol is supported on a venue — pre-flight for `price` / `ta` data sources | API key |

**x402 mode (`/x402/v2/auto/*`)** — note: some routes use POST instead of GET:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/x402/v2/auto/chat` | POST | Builder Chat |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries/validate` | POST | Validate EQL and preview cost |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries` | POST | Create and activate a query |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries/:queryId` | POST | Poll query status (POST, not GET) |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/cancel` | POST | Cancel an `active` query |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/stream` | GET | Stream notifications via SSE |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/sessions` | POST | List LLM sessions (POST, not GET) |
| `/x402/v2/auto/queries/:queryId/sessions/:sessionId` | POST | Get LLM session details (POST, not GET) |

> **Note on x402 Auto scope.** Drafts, executions, and the terminal-query DELETE endpoint are API-key-mode only. x402 Auto covers the core monitoring lifecycle (chat, validate, create, poll, cancel, stream, sessions). The account-wide stream `GET /v2/auto/queries/stream` is **not** exposed on x402 — x402 (and agent identities) get the per-query stream only.

> **Auto no longer accepts order actions.** New queries and drafts cannot use
> `market_order` or `limit_order`, at top level or in an `llm` callback — Athena rejects
> them with `EQL_INVALID_ACTION`. Existing stored trade queries stay readable, cancellable
> and deletable. Route follow-up execution through your own runner off a `webhook`,
> `notify` or `telegram_bot` action.

For full parameter details, see the [Elfa API documentation](https://docs.elfa.ai).

### Machine-readable sources (prefer these over scraping docs pages)

When you need exact endpoint metadata, load these instead of walking the docs page by page:

| Source | URL | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Endpoint manifest | `https://docs.elfa.ai/agent/endpoints.manifest.json` | Method/path, docs route, required headers, payment requirement, request/response examples |
| Docs map | `https://docs.elfa.ai/llms.txt` | Canonical page map + machine-readable links. A plain `GET https://docs.elfa.ai/` returns the same index as `text/plain` to any client that does not ask for HTML |
| Full docs text | `https://docs.elfa.ai/llms-full.txt` | Only when deeper page context is needed |
| OpenAPI spec | bundled at `references/swagger.json` | Exact schemas, params, and defaults |
| Latest skill | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elfa-ai/skills/main/skills/elfa-ai/SKILL.md` | Re-fetch this skill when you cannot install it |

The manifest URL is **stable** — earlier releases served a rotating
`assets/files/endpoints.manifest-*.json` path; use the `/agent/` path above.

Install or refresh the skill with `npx skills add elfa-ai/skills`.

If you are running inside a client that cannot execute commands, such as Claude Desktop,
there is an MCP server that exposes the same API as tools:
`npx -y @elfa-ai/mcp`. See [docs.elfa.ai/mcp](https://docs.elfa.ai/mcp). Where you can run
commands, prefer this skill — it costs no context until you use it.

When you are writing TypeScript or Python rather than calling the API by hand, the official
SDKs (`@elfa-ai/sdk`, `elfa-sdk`) wrap the same surface with typed responses, retries, and SSE
streaming. See [docs.elfa.ai/sdks](https://docs.elfa.ai/sdks).

## How to use this skill

### Step 1: Determine the mode

Check whether the user wants to **make a live call**, **get code/integration help**, or
**set up automated monitoring**.

- If the user says things like "show me trending tokens", "what's the sentiment on SOL",
  "get me the top mentions for ETH" → they want **live data**. Proceed to Step 2a. If it is
  unclear which endpoint fits, or the ask needs more than one call, see Step 2c.
- If the user says things like "how do I call the trending tokens endpoint", "give me a
  curl example", "help me integrate Elfa" → they want **code snippets**. Skip to Step 4.
- If the user mentions **x402**, **keyless**, **pay-per-request**, or **wallet-based access**
  → they want **x402 mode**. See Step 2b for live calls or Step 4 for code snippets.
- If the user mentions **Auto**, **alerts**, **triggers**, **monitoring**, **conditions**,
  **"alert me when"**, **"notify me if"**, **EQL**, or **Builder Chat** → they want
  **Auto**. Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 2a: Making live API calls (API key mode)

Use the `bash_tool` to call the Elfa API via curl.

**Getting the API key:**
1. Check if the `ELFA_API_KEY` environment variable is set. This is the preferred method.
2. If the env var is not set, **stop and prompt the user.** Offer both options:

   > To make live calls, you have two options:
   >
   > **Option A — API key on pay-as-you-go (recommended):** Register at
   > **https://go.elfa.ai/claude-skills** and top up a PAYG balance — $0.0145 per credit,
   > $20 minimum, card or USDC. Then set the key as the `ELFA_API_KEY` environment variable
   > (do not paste it directly into the chat). The free tier is being phased out, so start on
   > PAYG rather than free credits.
   >
   > **Option B — x402 keyless payments:** Pay per request with USDC on Base, Arbitrum,
   > Polygon, Avalanche, or Solana — no signup needed. See the
   > [x402 docs](https://docs.elfa.ai/x402-payments) for setup.

   Do not attempt any authenticated API calls without a key or x402 setup. Wait for the user.
3. **Credential safety:**
   - Always read the API key from the `ELFA_API_KEY` environment variable, never ask the
     user to paste it into the conversation.
   - Never log or expose the full API key in outputs — mask it when displaying curl commands.
   - **Never echo or print environment variables:** Do not run `echo $ELFA_API_KEY`, `env | grep ELFA`,
     `printenv`, or similar commands that would expose credentials in the transcript.
   - If a user does paste a key in chat, warn them to rotate it and set it as an env var instead.

**Plans, credits, and rate limits:**

Pay-per-use first: **PAYG** is $0.0145/credit at 60 RPM with an API key, drawn down from a
prepaid credit balance ($20 minimum top-up, card or USDC); **x402** is $0.0145/credit at
1,000 RPM with no account. Same per-credit price — pick on integration style. **The free tier
is being phased out**, so recommend PAYG (or x402) for any new integration.

Accounts already on PAYG keep $0.009 per credit until 28 September 2026, 16:00 UTC
(29 September, 00:00 SGT). x402 has no accounts, so its price applies to every payer at once.

Subscription plans:

| | Free (phasing out) | Grow | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly | $0 | $290 | Custom |
| Annual (15% off) | $0 | $2,958 | Custom |
| Credits / month | 1,000 | 40,000 | Custom |
| Rate limit | 60 RPM | 120 RPM | Custom |
| Agent Chat | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Agent Automation | — | ✓ | ✓ |

**What each tier unlocks:**
- **Free** (phasing out) — core social data: trending tokens, smart stats, top mentions,
  keyword mentions, event summaries, token news, trending contract addresses
  (Twitter + Telegram)
- **Grow** — everything in Free, plus token mindshare, sentiment-weighted mentions,
  **trending narratives**, and **Elfa Intelligence** (Agent Chat and Agent Automation)
- **Enterprise** — everything in Grow, plus custom credit and rate limits, **streaming AI Chat**
  (Ask Elfa, `POST /v2/chat/stream`), dedicated support, custom integrations, and priority support

Gate summary for the tier-restricted endpoints:

| Endpoint | Requires |
|---|---|
| `/v2/data/trending-narratives` | Grow+ or PAYG |
| `/v2/chat` | Grow+ or PAYG |
| `/v2/chat/stream` | **PAYG or Enterprise only** |
| `/v2/data/market-events` | Enterprise only — email sales@elfa.ai |

Exceeding monthly credits rejects further requests until the next month; exceeding the rate
limit returns `429` (honor `Retry-After`). If a user hits an authorization error on a gated
endpoint, they can move to PAYG, upgrade their plan, or use x402 instead. Full details at
https://go.elfa.ai/claude-skills.

**Making the call:**

```bash
curl -s -H "x-elfa-api-key: $ELFA_API_KEY" "https://api.elfa.ai/v2/aggregations/trending-tokens?timeWindow=24h&pageSize=10"
```

### Step 2b: Making live API calls (x402 keyless mode)

x402 lets any wallet pay per request using USDC on Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, or
Solana — no API key, no registration. This is ideal for agents, bots, and programmatic access.

**How x402 works:**
1. Send a request to the `/x402/v2/` version of any endpoint (no auth header).
2. The server responds with HTTP **402** containing payment requirements.
3. Your wallet signs a USDC transfer authorization (no gas fees).
4. Resend the request with the signed payment in the `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header.
5. Server verifies payment, serves the response, and settles on-chain.

**x402 signing and security:**
- Signing happens **entirely client-side** using the `@x402/fetch` or `@x402/axios`
  libraries. The agent never handles, stores, or transmits private keys.
- The user's wallet private key is used only locally by the x402 library to sign
  EIP-712 typed data authorizing a specific USDC amount for a specific request.
- Never ask the user to share their wallet private key or seed phrase in the conversation.
- When generating x402 code examples, use `"0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"` as a placeholder and
  advise the user to load it from an environment variable (e.g., `process.env.PRIVATE_KEY`).

**x402 details:**
- **Networks:** the server offers every supported network in the 402 response; your client
  signs on the first one it's registered for. Register the network(s) you hold USDC on.
- **Scheme:** `exact` (fixed price per request), plus `upto` (metered) on the chat endpoints;
  asset is native Circle USDC (6 decimals). `upto` needs a one-time Permit2 approval from the
  wallet — until that approval exists the server answers `412` instead of `402`, so approve and
  retry. It is available on the EVM networks below; Solana is `exact` only.
- **Errors:** responses return `{ code, message, errorId, requestId }` — branch on `code`.
  `requestId` is also the `x-request-id` response header. Two exceptions on the Auto endpoints:
  EQL validation failures return `422` with `{ valid, errors, warnings }`, and errors raised by
  the execution engine are passed through unchanged.
- **Status:** Currently in beta.

| Network | Chain ID | USDC Address | Facilitator |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base | `eip155:8453` | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` | [payai.network](https://facilitator.payai.network) |
| Arbitrum | `eip155:42161` | `0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831` | [payai.network](https://facilitator.payai.network) |
| Polygon | `eip155:137` | `0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359` | [payai.network](https://facilitator.payai.network) |
| Avalanche | `eip155:43114` | `0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E` | [payai.network](https://facilitator.payai.network) |
| Solana | `solana:5eykt4UsFv8P8NJdTREpY1vzqKqZKvdp` | `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` | [payai.network](https://facilitator.payai.network) |

EVM signing costs no gas. On Solana the facilitator pays the transaction fee.

**x402 pricing (data endpoints):**

| Tier | Credits | USDC Cost | Endpoints |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | 1 | $0.0145 | trending-tokens, smart-stats, keyword-mentions, token-news, top-mentions, trending-cas |
| Extended | 5 | $0.0725 | event-summary, trending-narratives |

Data endpoints are `exact` only. `/x402/v2/chat` is speed-based and offers both schemes — pay a
flat price with `exact`, or authorize a ceiling with `upto` and settle only what the turn used:

| Speed | `exact` (flat) | `upto` (charged up to) |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | $1 | $2 |
| `expert` (default) | $2 | $6 |

**Making an x402 call with curl (manual flow):**

```bash
# Step 1: Send request without payment — get 402 with payment requirements
curl -s https://api.elfa.ai/x402/v2/aggregations/trending-tokens?timeWindow=24h

# Step 2: After signing the payment payload with your wallet, resend with payment header
curl -s -H "PAYMENT-SIGNATURE: <base64-encoded-payment-payload>" \
  "https://api.elfa.ai/x402/v2/aggregations/trending-tokens?timeWindow=24h"
```

**Recommended: use the `@x402/fetch` library** which handles payment automatically:

```javascript
import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from "@x402/fetch";
import { ExactEvmScheme, toClientEvmSigner } from "@x402/evm";
import { x402Client } from "@x402/core/client";
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { privateKeyToAccount } from "viem/accounts";
import { base } from "viem/chains";

const account = privateKeyToAccount("0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
const publicClient = createPublicClient({ chain: base, transport: http() });
const signer = toClientEvmSigner(account, publicClient);

const client = new x402Client().register(
  "eip155:8453",
  new ExactEvmScheme(signer));

const x402Fetch = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, client);

// Use x402Fetch exactly like regular fetch — payment is handled automatically on 402 responses
const response = await x402Fetch(
  "https://api.elfa.ai/x402/v2/aggregations/trending-tokens?timeWindow=24h");
const data = await response.json();
```

To pay on another network, swap the `base` chain import and register that scheme instead —
e.g. Arbitrum (`arbitrum` from `viem/chains`, `eip155:42161`). Register a scheme for each
network you want to pay from; the client uses the first one the server also accepts.

**x402 with the Chat endpoint (POST):**

```javascript
const response = await x402Fetch(
  "https://api.elfa.ai/x402/v2/chat",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: "What is the current sentiment on BTC?",
      analysisType: "chat",
      speed: "fast", // exact: "fast" $1, "expert" $2 — upto: $2 / $6
    }),
  });
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.data.message);
```

**Presenting results:**
- Parse the JSON response and present it in a clean, readable format.
- For trending tokens: show a ranked table with token name, mention count, and change %.
- For mentions: show tweet links, engagement metrics, and account info.
  Note: Elfa returns tweet IDs but not tweet text content — let the user know they'll
  need their own X (Twitter) API key to fetch the actual tweet content.
- For narratives/summaries: present the narrative text with source links.
- For the chat endpoint: display the AI response cleanly.
- If the response contains an error, explain what went wrong and suggest fixes.

### Step 2c: Market Intelligence — picking the right endpoint

The data endpoints split into two tiers. Picking the wrong tier is the most common integration
mistake.

| Tier | Endpoints | What comes back |
|---|---|---|
| **Measurement** | `smart-stats` (legacy), `trending-cas/*`, `trending-tokens`, `top-mentions`, `keyword-mentions`, `token-news` | Counts, engagement metrics, links, account metadata. **Your system interprets them.** |
| **Interpretation** | `chat`, `chat/stream`, `event-summary`, `trending-narratives` | Written analysis or summaries, with source links where available. |

> **Measurement endpoints return no raw tweet text and no sentiment field.** They measure
> *attention*, not *meaning*. If the user needs post content, they must fetch the linked post
> with their own X API bearer token. If they need meaning, route to Chat, Event Summary, or
> Trending Narratives instead of trying to infer it from counts.

**Choose the surface:**

| User needs | Start here |
|---|---|
| A market question answered in plain language | `POST /v2/chat` |
| What is moving right now | `trending-tokens`, `trending-cas/*` |
| Who amplified a token or keyword | `top-mentions`, `keyword-mentions`, `smart-stats` |
| A defensible cause or theme behind a move | `token-news`, `event-summary`, `trending-narratives` |
| Continuous watching + notify/execute on a condition | Auto (Step 3) |

#### Agent playbooks (endpoint chains)

Single calls answer questions; chains produce signals. These are the documented combinations:

| Play | Chain | Why it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead time** | `trending-cas/telegram` → `trending-cas/twitter` | Telegram tends to lead; Twitter confirms. A CA in the first and not yet the second is early. |
| **Trust-weighted mentions** | `keyword-mentions` → `smart-stats` | `keyword-mentions` yields `account.username`; `smart-stats` says whether that account has real reach. |
| **Move + amplification** | `trending-tokens` → `top-mentions` | Find what moved, then see who drove it. |
| **Theme → instrument** | `trending-narratives` → `trending-tokens` | Turn a narrative into specific tickers to watch. |
| **Move + cause** | `token-news` → `event-summary` | Attach a written cause to a price/attention move. |
| **Question + evidence** | `chat` → targeted data endpoint | Chat gives the conclusion; the data endpoint gives numbers to verify it. |

When ranking accounts from `smart-stats`, use **ratios** (smart followers ÷ followers, average
reach ÷ followers), not absolute counts — the endpoint returns raw metrics, not a reputation
score.

> **`smart-stats` is legacy and will be removed on 28 October 2026.** It still works until
> then, and is not being extended before then. Chains that end in it keep working today, but
> build new integrations on `keyword-mentions`, which returns `account.username` alongside
> each mention's engagement metrics.

#### Chat — JSON vs streaming

| Surface | Endpoint | Plan | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| API key JSON | `POST /v2/chat` | Grow+ or PAYG | Client cannot consume SSE, or wants one complete JSON answer |
| API key SSE | `POST /v2/chat/stream` | **PAYG or Enterprise** | Client can consume SSE and wants incremental output |
| x402 JSON | `POST /x402/v2/chat` | Pay-per-request | Wallet-based agent, no API key |

Both surfaces take the **same request body**. `analysisType` decides the mode:

| Type | Use for | Required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `chat` | Open-ended questions | `message` |
| `macro` | Broad market conditions | none |
| `summary` | Fast pulse check | none |
| `tokenIntro` | What a token is and its narrative | `assetMetadata.symbol` **or** `assetMetadata.chain` + `assetMetadata.contractAddress` |
| `tokenAnalysis` | Entries, exits, market + on-chain context | same as `tokenIntro` |
| `accountAnalysis` | Vet an account's reach and agenda | `assetMetadata.username` |

`message` is **required only for `analysisType: "chat"`** — the other modes use the mode plus
`assetMetadata` and ignore free-form `message`. Omit `sessionId` to start a thread; pass the
returned `sessionId` back to continue it.

**Speed:** `fast` (shallower), `expert` (**default**), and `adaptive` (Elfa chooses) —
`adaptive` is available on `/v2/chat` but **not** on `/x402/v2/chat`.

**SSE event types on `/v2/chat/stream`** (each arrives as a `data:` payload with a `type`):

| Event | Payload |
|---|---|
| `session_info` | `sessionId`, `analysisType` |
| `title` | `title` — generated session/analysis title |
| `text` | `content` — incremental Markdown chunk |
| `text_complete` | incremental text finished |
| `status` | progress update (e.g. "Searching mentions…") |
| `credits` | `credits` — credits consumed so far |
| `complete` | final `sessionId`, `success`, `creditsConsumed` |
| `invalid_request` | query rejected by safety checks |
| `error` | stream failure |

A `: keep-alive` comment may arrive during long gaps. The stream terminates with
`data: [DONE]`. Returns `403` if the key is not PAYG or Enterprise.

```bash
curl -sN -X POST "https://api.elfa.ai/v2/chat/stream" \
  -H "x-elfa-api-key: $ELFA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"analysisType":"chat","message":"Why is BTC moving today?","speed":"expert"}'
```

#### Market Events

`GET /v2/data/market-events` returns impact-scored, deduplicated market events with supporting
source documents — useful when you want structured events rather than raw mentions.

> **Enterprise only.** Not enabled by default: a key without access gets `403`.
> Email sales@elfa.ai to request it. API-key mode only.

| Param | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `entities` | string (repeatable) | Filter by entity |
| `from` / `to` | RFC 3339 timestamp | Inclusive bounds |
| `limit` | integer | `1`–`200`, default `50` |
| `cursor` | string | Opaque cursor from `pagination.nextCursor` |

Each item carries `id`, `createdAt`, `alertAction` (`alert` \| `monitor`), `impactScore`
(`0`–`100`), `confidence` (`0`–`1`), `title` / `narrative` / `why`, `entities`, `tokens`,
`eventType`, `timeSensitivity`, `evidenceStrength`, `sourceQuality`, `novelty`, and
`sourceDocuments` (`id` + HTTPS `link` only — no tweet text, media, author, or metrics).
Pagination is under `data.pagination` (`limit`, `nextCursor`, `hasMore`).

#### Health check

`GET /v2/ping` needs **no** authentication — use it to confirm reachability before debugging
credential problems.

```bash
curl -s https://api.elfa.ai/v2/ping
```

### Step 3: Auto — Condition Engine and Trigger Pipeline

Auto is a managed **condition engine + trigger pipeline** for agents. You describe what to
watch for (price, technical indicators, LLM-evaluated conditions, scheduled checks,
prediction-market activity, funding rates, liquidation cascades, market sentiment), and Auto
evaluates continuously and fires actions when conditions resolve to true. Assets are not
crypto-only — HIP-3 perps cover equities, indices, commodities, FX, and pre-IPO names, 24/7.

Full Auto docs: [docs.elfa.ai/auto/overview](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/overview)

#### Lifecycle Sequence (Enforced)

For API key lifecycle/cleanup calls, preserve this order when each operation applies:

1. `POST /v2/auto/queries/validate` — validate EQL and preview cost
2. `POST /v2/auto/queries` — create and activate
3. `POST /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/cancel` — only if stopping an `active` query before it reaches terminal status (returns `409` once terminal)
4. `DELETE /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}` — only after status is terminal (`triggered` / `expired` / `cancelled` / `failed`); active queries must be cancelled first

> **Cancel and delete are distinct operations.** `POST /cancel` flips an active query to `cancelled` (terminal). `DELETE` removes the record entirely and only works on terminal queries. Sending `DELETE` on an active query returns `409 Conflict`.

x402 mode supports the same lifecycle except that x402 has no `DELETE` endpoint (cancel-only).

#### Intent Routing (Strict)

Pick the condition source by user intent **before** writing condition args:

| Intent | Required source | Minimum required fields |
|---|---|---|
| Account-anchored post intent (`@user posts ...`) | `source: "tweet"` | `args.username` (no `@`), `args.text`, `args.minConfidence` (use `80` if user gives no threshold) |
| Telegram-channel intent (`when this channel posts ...`) | `source: "telegram"` | one of `args.chatUsername` or `args.chatId`, plus `args.text`, `args.minConfidence` (use `80` if user gives no threshold) |
| World event intent (ETF approval, exploit, sanctions, etc.) | `source: "news"` | `args.text`, `args.minConfidence` (use `80` if user gives no threshold) |
| Official SEC filing intent (new 8-K, late 10-Q/10-K notice, offering, ownership filing, 8-K item) | `source: "sec"` | `method` (e.g. `base_form_type`, `form_category`, `has_item_1_05`), `args.ticker` as the issuer CIK, `operator`/`value` per the per-method allowlists |
| Prediction-market move/lifecycle on a named open Kalshi market | `source: "kalshi"` | `method` (e.g. `yes_price`, `status`, `result`), `args.ticker` (a currently-open Kalshi market), `operator`/`value` per the per-method allowlists |
| Prediction-market price/trade on a Polymarket outcome token | `source: "polymarket"` | `method` (`price`, `bid`, `ask`, `size`, `side`), `args.ticker` (outcome-token `asset_id`), `operator`/`value` per the per-method allowlists |
| Perp funding-rate intent (overheated funding, funding flips negative) | `source: "funding"` | `method` (prefer `annualized_rate`), `args.ticker` as `SYMBOL:EXCHANGE` (e.g. `BTC:BINANCE`) |
| Liquidation-flow intent (cascade, long/short flush) | `source: "liquidation"` | `method` (e.g. `total_usd_5m`, `total_pct_oi_1h`), `args.ticker` as `SYMBOL:EXCHANGE` |
| Market-wide sentiment (fear/greed regime) | `source: "fear_greed"` | `method` (`value` or `classification`), empty `args: {}` |
| Follow-graph intent (who followed a watched account, who it followed, or a tracked set converging on one account) | `source: "x_follow_received"` / `"x_follow_made"` / `"x_follow_overlap"` | `method` per source, `args.account` (or `args.accounts` for overlap), `operator` `>` or `>=` |
| Real-world catalyst moving an equity/index/commodity (rate decision, CPI, earnings) | the catalyst's own source (`kalshi` / `polymarket` / `news` / `price`), optionally with a HIP-3 `price` / `ta` confirmation | Pick the catalyst source, then bridge to the asset class it moves — see [Catalyst Triggers](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/catalyst-triggers) |
| Fuzzy world-state predicate not naturally expressible as a post or event | `source: "llm"` | `method: "athena_condition"`, `args.query`, `args.period` (`>= 1h`) |

When the prompt is account-anchored, **start with `tweet`** — do not route to `news` or `llm` first. When it is Telegram-channel-anchored, start with `telegram`. When the prompt is event-anchored without a specific account, start with `news` — unless it is an official SEC filing for an issuer, which routes to `sec`. When the trigger maps to a concrete prediction market you can name (a Kalshi ticker or a Polymarket outcome-token id), use `kalshi` / `polymarket` (prefer them over `llm` for supported methods). Use `llm` (`athena_condition`) only when the predicate cannot reasonably be matched against a post, event, or named prediction market.

#### When to suggest Auto

- User wants alerts based on **price thresholds** ("alert me when BTC crosses 100k")
- User wants alerts based on **technical indicators** ("notify when RSI drops below 30")
- User wants **scheduled checks** ("check every 4 hours") or **calendar schedules** ("every weekday at 9am New York time" — use `cron.schedule`)
- User wants the **same alert to keep firing on its own condition** ("notify me every time BTC dips below 60k") — add the top-level `repeat` object (`cooldown` + `maxTriggers`)
- User wants **narrative/sentiment monitoring** ("alert when AI token narrative shifts")
- User wants **multi-condition triggers** ("BTC above 100k AND ETH above 3500")
- User wants to **compare live metrics** ("alert when price crosses above Bollinger Band")
- User wants **LLM analysis on trigger** ("when it triggers, run a full analysis")
- User wants **account-anchored social triggers** ("notify me when @cz_binance posts that Binance Alpha is listing a new token") — use **Signal: X/Twitter Post** (`source: "tweet"`)
- User wants **Telegram-channel triggers** ("alert me when this channel posts a new Binance listing rumor") — use **Signal: Telegram Channel** (`source: "telegram"`)
- User wants **event-driven triggers** ("alert me when SEC approves a spot ETH ETF") — use **Signal: Event** (`source: "news"`)
- User wants **official SEC filing triggers** ("tell me when Alphabet files a new 8-K", "alert on any late 10-Q notice") — use `source: "sec"` with the issuer CIK
- User wants **prediction-market triggers** ("alert when this Kalshi market's YES probability crosses 60%", "notify when the market settles YES", "alert when this Polymarket outcome trades above 60c") — use **Prediction Markets** (`source: "kalshi"` or `source: "polymarket"`)
- User wants **funding / liquidation / sentiment triggers** ("alert when BTC funding flips negative", "notify on an ETH liquidation cascade", "alert when Fear & Greed drops below 20") — use `source: "funding"` / `"liquidation"` / `"fear_greed"`
- User wants **follow-graph triggers** ("tell me when someone big follows @elfa_ai", "alert when cobie follows a new account", "notify when 3 funds I track all follow the same account") — use `source: "x_follow_received"` / `"x_follow_made"` / `"x_follow_overlap"`
- User wants to **watch a macro catalyst on stocks/indices/commodities** ("tell me when the market prices a Fed cut", "alert on gold if CPI runs hot") — fire on the catalyst source and reference the HIP-3 perp, which trades 24/7. See [Catalyst Triggers](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/catalyst-triggers)

#### Auto access models

| Mode | Route prefix | Auth | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| API key | `/v2/auto/*` | `x-elfa-api-key` on all routes | Apps, dashboards |
| x402 keyless | `/x402/v2/auto/*` | x402 payment + `x-elfa-agent-secret` | AI agents, bots |

#### x402 Auto (keyless agent mode)

For x402 Auto, no API key is needed. Instead:
- Send the x402 payment header `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`. x402 **v2 only** — `X-PAYMENT` is accepted
  as an alias for the header name, but the payload must be a v2 payment payload
- Include `x-elfa-agent-secret` on all query lifecycle routes

**Agent secret management:**
Generate a strong secret once and reuse it for all calls:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# or: node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Persist as `ELFA_AGENT_SECRET`. **Do not rotate per request** — x402 session ownership is
derived from `SHA256(secret)`. If you change secrets, your agent identity changes and
existing queries/sessions may become inaccessible.

#### Auto pricing (both modes)

**API-key mode (`/v2/auto/*`) — charged against your credit balance:**

| Operation | Credits | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /v2/auto/chat` (Builder Chat) | `1 + dynamic` | Base 1 credit + `ceil(request_cost * 750)` dynamic charge based on LLM usage |
| `POST /v2/auto/queries` (Create) | Simulation-driven | Baseline `5` + per simulated LLM call: fast `+5`, expert `+18` |
| `POST /v2/auto/queries/validate` | Free | Returns cost estimate — always call before Create |
| `GET /v2/auto/queries/*` (list, poll, stream, sessions) | Free | |
| `POST /v2/auto/queries/:queryId/cancel` (Cancel active query) | Free | |
| `DELETE /v2/auto/queries/:queryId` (Delete terminal query) | Free | |
| `GET /v2/auto/validate-symbol/:exchange/:symbol` | Free | |

> Reference USD values for Create: baseline `$0.0725`, fast call `+$0.0725`, expert call `+$0.261`. Use `/queries/validate` to preview exact cost before committing.

**x402 mode (`/x402/v2/auto/*`) — pay-per-request in USDC on Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, or Solana:**

Builder Chat is speed-based with two schemes — a flat `exact` price, or an `upto` ceiling that
settles only what the turn actually used:

| Speed | `exact` (flat) | `upto` (charged up to) |
|---|---|---|
| `fast` | $1 | $2 |
| `expert` (default) | $2 | $6 |

| Operation | Credits | USDC Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Query creation — baseline | 5 | $0.0725 |
| Per fast LLM call | +5 | +$0.0725 |
| Per expert LLM call | +18 | +$0.261 |
| Validate, poll, cancel, sessions, stream | Free | Free |

**x402 Auto example:**

```javascript
// Validate a query (x402 Auto)
const response = await x402Fetch(
  "https://api.elfa.ai/x402/v2/auto/queries/validate",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-elfa-agent-secret": process.env.ELFA_AGENT_SECRET,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: {
        conditions: { AND: [{ source: "price", method: "current", args: { symbol: "BTC", exchange: "hyperliquid" }, operator: ">", value: 100000 }] },
        actions: [{ stepId: "step_1", type: "notify", params: { message: "BTC crossed 100k" } }],
        expiresIn: "24h"
      }
    }),
  });
```

#### Recommended call sequence (deterministic agent path)

**API key mode (`/v2/auto/*`):**

1. `POST /v2/auto/chat` — Ask Builder Chat to draft a query
2. `POST /v2/auto/queries/validate` — Validate EQL and preview cost
3. `POST /v2/auto/queries` — Create and activate
4. `GET /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/stream` — Stream notifications (or poll)
5. `GET /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/sessions` + `/sessions/{sessionId}` — Fetch LLM output (if using `llm` action)
6. (Optional cleanup) `POST /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/cancel` — Cancel only while `active` (returns `409` if already terminal)
7. (Optional cleanup) `DELETE /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}` — Delete only after terminal (`triggered` / `expired` / `cancelled` / `failed`); rejects active queries with `409`

**x402 mode (`/x402/v2/auto/*`):**

1. `POST /x402/v2/auto/chat` — Ask Builder Chat to draft a query
2. `POST /x402/v2/auto/queries/validate` — Validate EQL and preview cost
3. `POST /x402/v2/auto/queries` — Create and activate
4. `GET /x402/v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/stream` — Stream notifications (or poll via POST)
5. `POST /x402/v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/sessions` + `/sessions/{sessionId}` — Fetch LLM output
6. (Optional cleanup) `POST /x402/v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/cancel` — Cancel only while `active`. (x402 has no terminal-delete endpoint.)

**Always validate before create.** Validate returns structured errors you can iterate on
without spending credits.

**Failure handling order** (apply in sequence):

1. Retry transient network errors with exponential backoff.
2. On `400` / `422` validation failure → repair query using [Validation Errors table](#validation-errors--next-action-table), re-validate.
3. On `401` / `403` auth failure → refresh credentials or re-check the key's permissions.
4. On `402` x402 payment failure → re-price and retry with valid payment payload.
5. On `410` (SSE stream closed) → re-open stream or fall back to polling.

**Common agent flows:**

_Poll-based LLM flow:_
```
POST /v2/auto/queries                               → create query with action.type = "llm"
GET  /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}                     → poll until execution with sessionId appears
                                                      (latestEvaluation.conditionStates[] shows
                                                       progress while you wait)
GET  /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/sessions/{sessionId} → fetch full analysis
```

_Webhook-based LLM flow:_
```
POST /v2/auto/queries                               → create with action.type = "llm" and params.action
(wait for webhook)                                  → receive session reference / output
(optional) GET session fetch                        → /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/sessions/{sessionId}
```

#### Builder Chat

Builder Chat (`POST /v2/auto/chat` or `POST /x402/v2/auto/chat`) uses AI to translate
natural language into EQL queries. Use `sessionId` for multi-turn conversations.

```json
{
  "message": "Alert me when BTC breaks 100k with RSI confirmation above 55",
  "speed": "expert",
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id"
}
```

Response (API-key mode):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "session-uuid",
  "response": "I can help with that... (markdown + EQL JSON code block)",
  "title": "BTC Breakout Alert",
  "reasoning": null,
  "planIds": [],
  "credits": 100
}
```

`credits` carries what the turn cost — the same total as the `x-elfa-credits` header. Builder
Chat is dynamically priced, so read it instead of assuming a flat per-call cost.

The response message contains the AI's reply in Markdown. When it generates EQL, it will be
in a JSON code block — extract, validate via `/queries/validate`, then submit via `/queries`.

**Prompting tips for Builder Chat:**
- Include `title` and `description` (shown in notifications so recipients know what fired hours/days later)
- Specify symbols, timeframe, trigger behavior (one-time — the default — vs recurring), delivery target. For recurring on the **same condition**, ask for the `repeat` object (`cooldown` + `maxTriggers`); for a fixed schedule, use a `cron` condition
- For Signal triggers, give a **factual** match description (avoid vague phrasing like "bullish vibes")
- Append `"If anything is unsupported, return the closest supported query and list substitutions"` to handle edge cases gracefully
- Prefer `expiresIn` of `24h`–`3d` for fresh signals
- Persist `sessionId` and reuse it for follow-up prompts so the model keeps context across turns

**High-impact prompt pack** — drop these into `POST /v2/auto/chat` as the `message` field:

_1) Complex TA breakout with direction filter:_

```
Build an Auto query:
- title + description: short human-readable summary and 1-2 sentence thesis
- symbols: BTC, ETH, SOL
- timeframe: 5m

- one-time trigger, expires in 48h
If anything is unsupported, return the closest supported query and list substitutions.
```

_2) CEX + DEX monitoring pack:_

```
Build an Auto query pack for supported CEX + DEX symbols:

  - X sentiment summary
  - risk note
- also send telegram alert with a short summary
- expires in 24h
```

_4) Prediction-market thesis watcher (Kalshi):_

```
Build an Auto query:

```
Build an Auto query:
- title + description: breakout playbook name and the follow-up intent
- trigger on breakout + trend-confirmation conditions
- action: webhook to https://your-runner.example/auto/events
- include fields: eventId, symbol, triggerReason, priority, queryId
- downstream agent decides next action under policy constraints
- expires in 24h
```

_7) Signal — account-anchored X/Twitter Post watcher:_

```
Build an Auto query:
- title + description: short summary anchored to the account + intent
- use Signal category:
  - condition source: tweet
  - username: cz_binance (no leading @)
  - match description: "Binance Alpha is listing a new token"
  - minConfidence: 80
- action: notify (or telegram_bot) with a concise message
- expires in 24h
If unsupported, return closest supported query and list substitutions.
```

_8) Signal — event-first catalyst watcher:_

```
Build an Auto query:
- title + description: catalyst name and why it matters now
- use Signal category:
  - condition source: news
  - match description: "SEC approves a spot ETH ETF"
  - minConfidence: 80
- action: webhook to https://your-runner.example/auto/events
- include queryId, eventId, and short trigger reason in payload
- expires in 24h
```

#### Query model (EQL)

A query contains `conditions`, `actions`, and `expiresIn` (plus an optional `repeat`
sibling — by default a plan is one-shot; see **Repeat** below):

```json
{
  "title": "BTC RSI oversold on 1h",
  "description": "Mean-reversion entry: if BTC 1h RSI dips under 30, consider scaling in.",
  "conditions": {
    "AND": [
      {
        "source": "ta",
        "method": "rsi",
        "args": { "symbol": "BTC", "timeframe": "1h", "period": 14, "exchange": "hyperliquid" },
        "operator": "<",
        "value": 30
      }
    ]
  },
  "actions": [
    { "stepId": "step_1", "type": "webhook", "params": { "url": "https://your-endpoint.example/events" } }
  ],
  "expiresIn": "24h"
}
```

**Condition rules:**
- Root group must be `AND` or `OR`
- Nest groups up to depth 3, max 10 leaf conditions
- Multi-symbol: a single query can require BTC AND ETH AND SOL conditions jointly

**Allowed `expiresIn` values:** `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `24h`, `48h` (2d), `72h` (3d),
`120h` (5d), `168h` (7d), `240h` (10d), `336h` (14d), `504h` (21d), `720h` (30d — hard max).
**Prefer `24h`–`72h`** — signals decay and short windows force re-evaluation. Only reach for
`240h`–`720h` on slow structural theses (token unlocks, options expiries, monthly
copy-trading), never on short-timeframe TA/scalps.

**Plan limits (active plans per account):** an account can only hold so many **active** plans
at once, by API key tier — Free `2`, Grow `50`, PAYG/Enterprise unlimited. A hard
ceiling of **500 active plans** applies regardless of tier; exceeding either cap returns
`409`. Only *active* plans count — expired/cancelled/terminal plans free capacity, so
cancelling stale plans (or choosing a shorter `expiresIn`) is the fastest way to make room.

**Repeat (`repeat`) — recurring plans on their own conditions:**

By default a plan is **one-shot**: it fires once and moves to a terminal state. The optional
top-level `repeat` object (a sibling of `expiresIn`) keeps a plan active and makes it re-fire
on **its own** conditions — the right tool for "notify me *every time* BTC dips below 60k"
without a fixed cron cadence.

```json
{
  "conditions": { "AND": ["..."] },
  "actions": ["..."],
  "expiresIn": "7d",
  "repeat": { "cooldown": "1h", "maxTriggers": 10 }
}
```

Both fields are **mandatory** when `repeat` is present:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `cooldown` | string | Minimum time between fires. `"0"` disables the rate limit. |
| `maxTriggers` | number | Lifetime cap on fires (`1`–`1000`); reaching it makes the plan terminal. |

- **`cooldown` allowed values** (its own set — sub-hour is permitted, unlike the cron/llm 1h minimum): `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `24h`, `1d`, `7d`, plus `"0"`. Use `"0"` for "fire on every distinct event" (e.g. every matching tweet or Telegram message).
- **`maxTriggers`** counts how many times the plan **fires** over its lifetime (distinct from the number of action steps). Sanity-check `cooldown × maxTriggers` against `expiresIn` — if there isn't enough runway, the plan expires before reaching the cap. A longer `expiresIn` buys patience through quiet periods; it does **not** raise the fire cap.
- **Single reset rule.** A `repeat` plan re-fires only once its triggering signal has cleared. **Level** conditions (`price` / `ta` / `llm`-boolean) disarm on fire and re-arm when the whole condition tree next evaluates false; **event** conditions (`tweet.semantic` / `telegram.semantic` / `news.semantic` / `sec`) consume the matched event and re-fire on the **next distinct** event.

> **Still rejected:** `repeat` combined with a recurring cron condition (`cron.every` /
> `cron.schedule`) — both provide recurrence, so combining them fails validation as
> `EQL_INVALID_REPEAT`. For a fixed-cadence recurring plan, use the cron condition on its own;
> for a condition-driven recurring plan, use `repeat`.

**Avoiding over-triggering:** the main risk is a condition that keeps flipping true — a
metric flapping around its threshold, or a chatty account. `cooldown` is your rate-limit
floor (never use `"0"` on level/metric conditions); `maxTriggers` is your hard circuit
breaker (set it conservatively so a runaway condition self-limits). A **level** condition
like `price < 60000` fires on *every* re-crossing, so prefer transition operators
(`crosses_below` / `crosses_above` over `<` / `>`), give the threshold room from the current
value, match `cooldown` to the signal's timeframe, and start conservative then loosen.

Recommended starting points:

| Condition type | `cooldown` | `maxTriggers` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price / TA level (`price`, `ta`) | `1h`–`4h` (≥ your timeframe) | `3`–`10` | Prefer `crosses_*` operators; avoid `"0"` here. |
| LLM predicate (`llm.athena_condition`) | `≥ period` (min `1h`) | `3`–`5` | The LLM already re-checks on `period` — don't re-alert faster than it re-evaluates. |
| Event — single / quiet account or channel (`tweet`, `telegram`) | `0`–`15m` | `10`–`20` | Each distinct post/message is a discrete event; `"0"` is fine unless the source is chatty. |
| Event — noisy account/channel or broad `news` | `15m`–`1h` | `10`–`20` | A small cooldown collapses a burst of mentions into one alert. |
| SEC filing event (`sec`) | `0`–`1h` | `10`–`20` | Use `"0"` when you want every matching filing; add cooldown for noisy form categories. |
| Liquidation cascade (`liquidation`) | `1h`+ | `5`–`10` | Windows decay to zero, so the plan re-arms per cascade; the cooldown stops one long cascade re-alerting. |

**Allowed action types:** `webhook`, `notify`, `telegram_bot`, `llm`. The `actions` array is **exactly one step** per query — run standalone LLM work with `params.action`; chain follow-up work via `llm` action with `params.callback.action`, or have your runner fan out from the trigger event.

**Action params shape (key fields):**

| `type` | Required `params` | Optional `params` |
|---|---|---|
| `notify` | `message` (1–1000 chars) | — |
| `webhook` | `url` (https only, allowlisted host) | `signingSecret` (write-only — **set this in production**), `allNotifications` (default `false`) |
| `telegram_bot` | `botToken`, `chatId` | `allNotifications` (default `false`) |
| `llm` | `action` ∈ `chat` / `summary` / `macro` / `accountAnalysis` / `tokenDiscovery` / `tokenAnalysis` | `callback.action` for chained follow-up, `speed` (`fast` / `expert`), per-action extras (for example `message` on `chat`) |

`telegram_bot` does **not** take a `message` field — the message body is auto-composed from the query `title` + `description` + trigger context. Use `notify` (in-app push) when you want to specify the message text yourself. `allNotifications: true` on `webhook` / `telegram_bot` opts the destination into lifecycle notifications (failed/expired/run-failed) in addition to the trigger fire.

#### Triggers — condition sources

**Market-data venue (`exchange`) — REQUIRED on every `price` and `ta` condition:**

Every `price` and `ta` condition must include an `exchange` arg that selects which venue's
market data backs the condition. Allowed values: `hyperliquid`, `gmx`, `binance` (exact
lowercase enum). This arg **only affects the data source** of the condition. A `price`/`ta`
condition without `exchange` fails validation.

Per-venue data notes:
- `price.volume` is **not available on `gmx`** — GMX bars carry no per-bar volume. Use
  `hyperliquid` or `binance` for volume conditions.
- `binance` reads its **USD-M perp** markets and uses Binance's own base-symbol convention
  (`1000PEPE`, not `kPEPE`), validated against Binance's live perp catalog at create time.

```json
{ "source": "price", "method": "current", "args": { "symbol": "BTC", "exchange": "hyperliquid" }, "operator": ">", "value": 100000 }
```

**Price source (`price`):**

| Method | Args | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `current` | `symbol`, `exchange` | number | Current price |
| `change` | `symbol`, `exchange`, `period` | number | % change over period |
| `high` | `symbol`, `exchange`, `period` | number | High in period |
| `low` | `symbol`, `exchange`, `period` | number | Low in period |
| `volume` | `symbol`, `exchange`, `period` | number | Volume (USD) over period. Not available on `gmx`. |

**TA source (`ta`) — technical indicators:** every method also requires `symbol`, `timeframe`, **and `exchange`**.

| Method | Required args | Optional args | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rsi` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 14) | RSI (0-100) |
| `macd_value` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | — | MACD line |
| `macd_signal` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | — | MACD signal line |
| `macd_histogram` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | — | MACD histogram |
| `bbands_upper` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 20) | Upper Bollinger Band |
| `bbands_middle` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 20) | Middle Bollinger Band |
| `bbands_lower` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 20) | Lower Bollinger Band |
| `ema` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange`, `period` | — | Exponential MA |
| `sma` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange`, `period` | — | Simple MA |
| `atr` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 14) | Average True Range |
| `stoch_k` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | — | Stochastic %K |
| `stoch_d` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | — | Stochastic %D |
| `cci` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 20) | CCI |
| `willr` | `symbol`, `timeframe`, `exchange` | `period` (default 14) | Williams %R |

**TA critical rules:**
- Every `ta` (and `price`) condition **requires `exchange`** (`hyperliquid`, `gmx`, or `binance`)
- `ema` and `sma` **require** `period` — it is NOT optional
- `rsi`, `bbands_*`, `atr`, `cci`, and `willr` accept optional `period` with documented defaults above
- `period` must be a JSON number (`14`), not a string (`"14"`)
- Use `period` not `length` — `length` is not a recognized alias
- `timeframe` values: `1m`, `5m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `1d`

**Cron source (`cron`):**

| Method | Args | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `once` | `period` | True on first due evaluation at/after creation + period |
| `onceRemainTrue` | `period` | True on first due evaluation and stays true |
| `every` | `period` | True at each period interval |
| `schedule` | `expression`, `timezone?` | True whenever the 5-field cron `expression` matches in `timezone` |

`once`, `onceRemainTrue`, and `every` are **interval** methods measured from query creation.
`schedule` is a **calendar/wall-clock** method:

- `expression` is a classic **5-field** cron string (`minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`) — e.g. `0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays at 09:00).
- `timezone` is optional and defaults to `UTC`. When set it must be a valid **IANA** name (e.g. `America/New_York`, `Asia/Singapore`) so daylight-saving transitions are handled correctly. Fixed-offset strings like `+02:00` are **not** accepted.
- `schedule` enforces the same **1h-minimum cadence** as the other cron methods: the minute field must be a single fixed value (`0`–`59`). Wildcards, steps, lists, or ranges in the minute field are rejected.
  - Allowed: `7 * * * *` (hourly at minute 7), `0 9 * * 1-5` (weekdays 09:00), `30 8 * * *` (daily 08:30).
  - Not allowed: `* * * * *` (every minute), `*/15 * * * *` (every 15 min), `0,30 * * * *` (twice per hour).
- `schedule` takes **no** `period` arg.

> **Builder Chat support pending:** `cron.schedule` is available on the direct EQL/API path
> (Validate / Create). Builder Chat does not yet reliably generate `cron.schedule` — author
> calendar schedules directly and confirm with `/v2/auto/queries/validate`.

**LLM source (`llm`):**

| Method | Args | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `athena_condition` | `query`, `period`, `speed?` | LLM-evaluated condition (natural language) |

**Signal source — X/Twitter Post (`tweet`):**

In the Builder Chat catalog this is the `Signal` category, **X/Twitter Post**.

| Method | Required args | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic` | `username`, `text`, `minConfidence` | boolean | Matches posts from a specific X/Twitter account when semantic confidence meets threshold |

Rules:
- `username` must be passed **without** `@` (e.g. `cz_binance`, not `@cz_binance`).
- `username` must resolve to an active monitored account at create-time, otherwise validation/create fails.
- `minConfidence` must be a JSON integer between `0` and `100`; use `80` when the user gives no threshold.
- `method`, `operator`, and `value` are auto-filled defaults (`semantic`, `==`, `true`) — do **not** include them in the condition JSON.

```json
{
  "source": "tweet",
  "args": {
    "username": "cz_binance",
    "text": "Binance Alpha is listing a new token",
    "minConfidence": 80
  }
}
```

**Signal source — Telegram Channel (`telegram`):**

In the Builder Chat catalog this is the `Signal` category, **Telegram Channel**.

| Method | Required args | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic` | `chatUsername` and/or `chatId`, `text`, `minConfidence` | boolean | Matches messages from a monitored public Telegram channel when semantic confidence meets threshold |

Rules:
- Provide `chatUsername`, `chatId`, or both on the full method form. The shorthand condition form requires exactly one identifier; if both are present on a full condition they must resolve to the same channel.
- Prefer `chatUsername` without `@` or `t.me/` when you know the public channel username.
- Use `chatId` only when it came from tooling or an existing plan; it must be a signed 64-bit integer string.
- The channel must resolve to a monitored public Telegram channel at create-time, otherwise validation/create fails.
- `minConfidence` must be a JSON integer between `0` and `100`; use `80` when the user gives no threshold.

```json
{
  "source": "telegram",
  "args": {
    "chatUsername": "<monitored_public_channel_username>",
    "text": "new Binance listing rumor",
    "minConfidence": 80
  }
}
```

**Signal source — Event (`news`):**

In the Builder Chat catalog this is the `Signal` category, **Event**.

| Method | Required args | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic` | `text`, `minConfidence` | boolean | Matches event-style mentions from news-tagged sources when semantic confidence meets threshold |

Rules:
- `minConfidence` must be a JSON integer between `0` and `100`; use `80` when the user gives no threshold.
- `method`, `operator`, and `value` are auto-filled defaults — do **not** include them.
- Use `news` for world events not anchored to a specific account; use `tweet` when the trigger is anchored to a specific handle, `telegram` when it is anchored to a channel, and `sec` when it is an official SEC filing for an issuer.

```json
{
  "source": "news",
  "args": {
    "text": "SEC approves a spot ETH ETF",
    "minConfidence": 80
  }
}
```

**Signal selection policy** (which source to pick):

- Account-anchored intent (handle in the prompt) → `tweet`.
- Channel-anchored intent (a public Telegram channel in the prompt) → `telegram`.
- World-event intent (no specific account) → `news`.
- Official SEC filing intent (issuer CIK, form type, 8-K item) → `sec`.
- Prefer `tweet`/`telegram`/`news` over `llm` when the trigger is plausibly expressed as a post or event.
- Fall back to `llm` (`athena_condition`) only for predicates that are not naturally a post/event match.

**Signal `args.text` authoring rubric** — match quality is dominated by `text` quality. Write a short factual claim, not a monitoring command.

| Weak phrasing (bad) | Actionable phrasing (good) |
|---|---|
| `Bearish vibes` | `Opens a short position on oil` |
| `Something bullish` | `Announces a new stake in TSLA` |
| `Bullish on a coin` | `Posts that they're bullish on $HYPE and $SOL` |
| `Alpha group update` | `new Binance listing rumor` |
| `Team news` | `team confirms mainnet launch` |
| `Market crash` | `Major DeFi protocol suffers a $200M exploit` |
| `War conflict` | `US imposes new sanctions on Russia` |
| `Big news` | `SEC approves a spot ETH ETF` |

Additional constraints:
- Keep `text` atomic — one event/theme per condition.
- For `tweet`, do not restate account identity in `text` — `username` already scopes that.
- For `telegram`, do not restate channel identity in `text` — `chatUsername` or `chatId` already scopes that.
- Split `A or B` intents into multiple Signal conditions joined by `OR`; split `A and B` into multiple conditions joined by `AND`.
- Prefer separate queries for event-driven Signal intents (`tweet`/`telegram`/`news`) and recurring schedule intents (`cron.every`) for clearer runtime semantics.

**`minConfidence` tuning:** default `80`; raise to `85`–`90` for fewer false positives; lower to `70`–`75` if you need higher recall.

**Scheduling period (cron / llm):** for `cron` **interval** methods (`once`,
`onceRemainTrue`, `every`) and `llm` sources, `period` is a scheduling interval with a
minimum of `1h`. Allowed: `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `24h`, `1d`, `7d`. `cron.schedule`
does **not** take a `period` — it is driven by its 5-field cron `expression` and follows the
same 1h-minimum cadence (at most one fire per hour).

**Signal sources are event-driven**, not schedule-driven — they evaluate when relevant mention events arrive, not on a polling interval. They can still be combined with other condition types via `AND`/`OR`.

**SEC filings source (`sec`):**

Trigger on enriched SEC filing metadata — a new 8-K, a late periodic filing notice, an
offering form, or a specific 8-K item. `sec` conditions use the full EQL condition form and
obey the standard limits (depth 3, 10 leaves), so they combine with other sources in
`AND`/`OR` groups.

**CIK routing:** `args.ticker` is the issuer's **CIK**, not the stock ticker. It must be 1–10
digits, is trimmed, and is normalized to a 10-digit zero-padded CIK (`"1652044"` →
`"0001652044"`). Validate/create checks the CIK against SEC submissions metadata and rejects
unknown or malformed values rather than creating a plan that can never fire.

| Method | Returns | Operators | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `base_form_type` | enum | `==` `!=` | Normalized base form — amendments stripped (`10-K/A` → `10-K`), `424B*` → `424B` |
| `form_category` | enum | `==` `!=` | `current_report`, `periodic_report`, `ownership`, `offering`, `proxy_ma`, `listing`, `registered_fund`, `sec_review`, `other` |
| `is_amendment` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Form ends in `/A` |
| `is_late_filing` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Late notification form (`NT 10-K`, `NT 10-Q`, `NT 20-F`) |
| `is_offering` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Offering, registration, or prospectus-style filing |
| `is_ownership_filing` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Insider, beneficial, or institutional ownership filing |
| `has_item_1_03` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 1.03 — bankruptcy or receivership |
| `has_item_1_05` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 1.05 — material cybersecurity incident |
| `has_item_2_02` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 2.02 — results of operations |
| `has_item_2_05` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 2.05 — exit or disposal costs |
| `has_item_3_01` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 3.01 — delisting or listing-compliance notice |
| `has_item_4_01` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 4.01 — change of certifying accountant |
| `has_item_5_02` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 5.02 — director/officer changes |
| `has_item_8_01` | boolean | `==` `!=` | 8-K Item 8.01 — other reported events |
| `has_primary_document` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Primary filing document name was found |
| `has_xbrl` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Archive includes XBRL artifacts |
| `submission_match_found` | boolean | `==` `!=` | Accession matched inside SEC submissions metadata |
| `document_count` | number | `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` | Number of archive documents discovered |

```json
{
  "source": "sec",
  "method": "base_form_type",
  "args": { "ticker": "0001652044" },
  "operator": "==",
  "value": "8-K"
}
```

Use `base_form_type` when the user names a specific form, `form_category` for a filing
family, and the boolean methods for normalized flags (`is_late_filing` for NT notices,
`is_offering` for registrations and prospectuses, `has_item_1_05` for cybersecurity
disclosures). `sec` is event-driven like the Signal sources, so with `repeat` it re-fires on
the next distinct filing. Full reference:
[SEC Filings](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/sec-filings).

**Prediction Markets source (`kalshi`):**

Trigger on Kalshi prediction-market activity — live trade prints and market lifecycle. Each
`kalshi` condition takes exactly one arg, `ticker`: a full open Kalshi market ticker
(e.g. `KXBTC-26APR0803-T77799.99` = series + event + strike). Prefer `kalshi` over `llm` when
the trigger is a supported Kalshi method, and over `price`/`ta` when you care about an event's
*implied probability* rather than an asset's spot price.

_Trade-backed methods_ — evaluate on the latest executed trade print:

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `yes_price` | number `0`–`1` | Executed YES price = live implied probability of YES |
| `no_price` | number `0`–`1` | Executed NO price (implied probability of NO) |
| `trade_size` | number ≥ 0 | Contracts on that print |
| `taker_outcome_side` | enum `yes` / `no` | Which outcome the aggressor (taker) positioned for |
| `taker_book_side` | enum `bid` / `ask` | `bid` = YES-side pressure, `ask` = NO-side pressure |
| `is_block_trade` | boolean | `true` for large off-book negotiated block trades |

_Market-backed methods_ — evaluate on market lifecycle updates:

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | enum `active` / `closed` / `determined` / `settled` / `finalized` | Lifecycle state (`active` = only tradeable state) |
| `result` | enum `yes` / `no` | Settlement outcome (empty until the market resolves) |
| `settlement_value` | number ≥ 0 | Final settlement value in dollars (populated on settlement) |

**Operators by method** (restricted per method):

| Method(s) | Allowed operators |
|---|---|
| `yes_price`, `no_price` | `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` `crosses_above` `crosses_below` |
| `trade_size`, `settlement_value` | `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` |
| `taker_outcome_side`, `taker_book_side`, `status`, `result`, `is_block_trade` | `==` `!=` |

Only the price methods (`yes_price` / `no_price`) support the transition operators
`crosses_above` / `crosses_below`; enum and boolean methods are equality-only. `value` must be
a **literal** matching the method's type (no dynamic field-vs-field values), and
`is_block_trade` takes a JSON boolean `true` / `false` (not the strings `"true"` / `"false"`).

**Open markets only:** at create/validate time `args.ticker` is checked against the catalog of
**currently-open** Kalshi markets. A `closed` / `determined` / `settled` / `finalized` ticker
is rejected with `EQL_INVALID_ARG_VALUE` ("was not found or is not open"). Resolve a real,
currently-open ticker first — never invent or guess tickers. Lifecycle conditions are still
useful on a market you already watch: a plan created while a market is `active` can fire as it
later moves to `settled` (`status`) or resolves (`result` / `settlement_value`) within its
`expiresIn` window.

```json
{
  "source": "kalshi",
  "method": "yes_price",
  "args": { "ticker": "KXBTC-26APR0803-T77799.99" },
  "operator": "crosses_below",
  "value": 0.4
}
```

**Prediction Markets source (`polymarket`):**

Trigger on live Polymarket outcome-token activity: last traded price, best bid/ask, and the
size and aggressor side of the most recent trade. Unlike Kalshi, Polymarket exposes **price
and trade methods only** — there are **no** market-lifecycle (`status` / `result`) methods.

**Ticker = outcome-token `asset_id`.** For Polymarket, `args.ticker` is the **outcome token
`asset_id`** — the long numeric id of a single outcome (e.g. the YES token), **not** the
top-level Polymarket market id (which is shared by both sides of a binary market). At create
time the token is validated against Polymarket's live markets; an unknown or inactive token
is rejected ("was not found or is not active"). Resolve a real, currently-active
outcome-token id first — never invent or guess ids.

Each method takes exactly one arg, `ticker`:

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `price` | number in `[0, 1]` | Last traded probability / price for the outcome token |
| `bid` | number in `[0, 1]` | Best bid for the outcome token (when present on the event) |
| `ask` | number in `[0, 1]` | Best ask for the outcome token (when present on the event) |
| `size` | number ≥ 0 | Size of the last-trade update (when present on the event) |
| `side` | enum `"BUY"` / `"SELL"` | Aggressor side of the last trade, in uppercase |

The feed mixes several event subtypes (`price_change`, `best_bid_ask`, `last_trade_price`,
`book`), and **not every field updates on every event** — `best_bid_ask` updates `bid`/`ask`
only, while `last_trade_price` updates `price`/`size`/`side` only. Design a condition around
the specific field you need rather than assuming all fields move together.

**Operators by method** (restricted per method):

| Method(s) | Allowed operators |
|---|---|
| `price`, `bid`, `ask` | `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` `crosses_above` `crosses_below` |
| `size` | `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` |
| `side` | `==` `!=` |

`value` must be a **literal** matching the method's type (`0`–`1` for `price`/`bid`/`ask`,
≥ 0 for `size`, uppercase `"BUY"` / `"SELL"` for `side`). Polymarket conditions **do not
support dynamic (field-vs-field) values** — dynamic Polymarket targets are rejected at
validation.

```json
{
  "source": "polymarket",
  "method": "price",
  "args": { "ticker": "115556263888245616435851357148058235707004733438163639091106356867234218207169" },
  "operator": "crosses_below",
  "value": 0.4
}
```

Standard EQL limits apply to both prediction-market sources: combinable with other sources
inside `AND`/`OR` groups, up to depth 3 and 10 leaf conditions. Full method tables and
example automations:
[Prediction Markets → Polymarket](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/prediction-markets#polymarket).

**Market-structure source (`funding`) — perp funding rate:**

Trigger on a perp's funding rate — an overheated long bias, a flip to negative, or a
cross-venue divergence. Funding and liquidation flow often lead the spot price reaction.

**Ticker = composite `SYMBOL:EXCHANGE`** (not `symbol` + `exchange` args). `SYMBOL` is the
base asset (`BTC`, not `BTCUSDT`); the venue rides in the ticker. Venues: `binance`,
`hyperliquid`. Examples: `BTC:BINANCE`, `ETH:HYPERLIQUID`.

| Method | Args | Returns | Operators | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `annualized_rate` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | **Canonical.** Funding as annualized percent (APR): `32.85` = 32.85% APR. Positive = longs pay shorts. |
| `interval_rate` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | Percent per settlement interval. |
| `interval_hours` | `ticker` | number | level only | Settlement interval in hours: `8` (Binance) or `1` (Hyperliquid). Venue metadata. |
| `exchange` | `ticker` | enum | `==` / `!=` | The venue: `"binance"` or `"hyperliquid"`. |

- **Prefer `annualized_rate`** — Binance settles every 8h and Hyperliquid every 1h, so the
  same `interval_rate` threshold means different things per venue; annualizing removes that
  trap. "Funding flips negative" is exactly `annualized_rate crosses_below 0`.
- "level only" = `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `==` `!=` (no `crosses_*`).
- HIP-3 dex-prefixed symbols (`xyz:TSLA`) are **rejected** here (`EQL_INVALID_ARG_VALUE`,
  `details.hip3: true`) — the funding feed never publishes keys for them.

```json
{ "source": "funding", "method": "annualized_rate", "args": { "ticker": "BTC:BINANCE" }, "operator": "crosses_below", "value": 0 }
```

**Market-structure source (`liquidation`) — liquidation flow:**

Trigger on liquidation flow in a trailing window — a cascade crossing a USD threshold, a
one-sided flush, or liquidations as a share of open interest. Same composite
`SYMBOL:EXCHANGE` ticker as `funding`. Venues: `binance`, `bybit`, `hyperliquid`.

| Method | Args | Returns | Operators | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `total_usd_1m` / `total_usd_5m` / `total_usd_1h` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | Total USD liquidated in the trailing window. |
| `long_usd_1m` / `long_usd_5m` / `long_usd_1h` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | Longs liquidated (forced selling). |
| `short_usd_1m` / `short_usd_5m` / `short_usd_1h` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | Shorts liquidated (forced buying). |
| `largest_order_usd_1h` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | Single biggest liquidation order in the trailing hour, USD. |
| `count_1h` | `ticker` | number | level only | Number of liquidation orders in the trailing hour. |
| `total_pct_oi_1m` / `total_pct_oi_5m` / `total_pct_oi_1h` | `ticker` | number | all 8 | Window total as a **percent of open interest** (compares across symbols). |
| `exchange` | `ticker` | enum | `==` / `!=` | The venue: `"binance"` / `"bybit"` / `"hyperliquid"`. |

- **Feed quality differs by venue.** Binance is **sampled** (≤1 liquidation/symbol/second) so
  its values are a **lower bound** and undercount most during the cascades you care about;
  Bybit and Hyperliquid are **complete** (exact totals). Set a lower threshold on Binance for
  the same real-world event.
- **Windows decay to zero** once a cascade subsides, which re-arms the condition — so a
  `repeat` plan fires **once per cascade**, not once ever.
- `total_pct_oi_*` magnitudes are **small**: ~0.1%/hr is already heavy for a major; start
  around `0.5`–`1` (percent), not raw fractions. HIP-3 symbols are **rejected** here too.

```json
{ "source": "liquidation", "method": "total_usd_5m", "args": { "ticker": "ETH:BYBIT" }, "operator": "crosses_above", "value": 500000 }
```

**Market-sentiment source (`fear_greed`) — Crypto Fear & Greed Index:**

Trigger on the market-wide Crypto Fear & Greed Index. This is a **keyless** source — one
global reading, no per-market identity — so its methods take **no ticker**. Pass
`args: {}`.

| Method | Args | Returns | Operators | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | _(none)_ | number | all 8 | Index score, integer `0`–`100` (0 = extreme fear, 100 = extreme greed). |
| `classification` | _(none)_ | enum | `==` / `!=` | Bucket label (see below). |

- `classification` value ∈ `"Extreme fear"` (`0–19`), `"Fear"` (`20–39`), `"Neutral"`
  (`40–59`), `"Greed"` (`60–79`), `"Extreme greed"` (`80–100`). Bands map to fixed `value`
  ranges — **prefer `value`** for a precise threshold.
- Updates ~every 15 min. A `crosses_*` leaf needs a prior reading, so it can only fire on the
  **second** reading after activation. No dynamic values.

```json
{ "source": "fear_greed", "method": "value", "args": {}, "operator": "crosses_below", "value": 20 }
```

**Follow-graph sources (`x_follow_received`, `x_follow_made`, `x_follow_overlap`) — new X
follow edges:**

Three sources ask three questions about the same data. The account you name is always the
**watched** account; the method describes the account on the other end of the edge.

| Source | Method | Args | Returns | Operators | Measures |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `x_follow_received` | `follower_count` | `account`, `window?`, `period?` | number | `>` / `>=` | Follower count of the account that followed the watched account. |
| `x_follow_made` | `followee_follower_count` | `account`, `window?`, `period?` | number | `>` / `>=` | Follower count of the account the watched account followed. |
| `x_follow_overlap` | `distinct_followers` | `accounts` (2–25), `window?`, `period?` | number | `>` / `>=` | How many watched accounts followed the same account. |

Only `>` and `>=` are accepted — no `crosses_*`, no dynamic field-vs-field values. Accounts are
bare X usernames (1–15 letters, digits or underscores); a leading `@` is stripped, routing is
lowercased, and duplicates in `accounts` collapse to one.

| Arg | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `window` | `6h`, `12h`, `24h`, `48h`, `72h`, `7d` | `24h` (`72h` for `x_follow_overlap`) |
| `period` | `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `8h`, `12h`, `24h`, `1d`, `7d` | `1h` |

`window` is the lookback over **detection** time; `period` is the minimum interval between
reads. A `period` longer than `window` is silently clamped down to `window` rather than
rejected.

```json
{ "source": "x_follow_received", "method": "follower_count", "args": { "account": "elfa_ai", "window": "24h" }, "operator": ">", "value": 10000 }
```

```json
{ "source": "x_follow_overlap", "method": "distinct_followers", "args": { "accounts": ["pantheracapital", "a16z", "paradigm"], "window": "72h" }, "operator": ">=", "value": 2 }
```

On `x_follow_received` / `x_follow_made`, `>= 0` matches every detected follow and a higher
value narrows to accounts with a real audience. On `x_follow_overlap` the `value` floor is `2`
and it cannot exceed the size of `accounts` (one below it with `>`) — either is rejected at
create time.

Coverage is bounded and the limits change how you should write the plan: only follows by
accounts inside Elfa's tracked set are seen, data is collected on a recurring check rather
than streamed so alerts are **not real time**, at most 500 matches land per evaluation, and
unfollows and re-follows never fire. A quiet plan means no tracked account made that follow —
it does not prove nobody did. `x_follow_made` and `x_follow_overlap` read the watched
account's own following list, so those accounts must themselves be ones Elfa monitors;
`x_follow_received` has no such requirement.

Each matched account is a distinct event: without `repeat` the first match triggers the plan
once, and with `repeat` it fires once per distinct matched account (`cooldown: "0"` for
"notify me about every one"). A matched account will not fire again while it stays inside
`window`, and a follow condition reports no value until its first scheduled evaluation, so
there is no preview before execution. Builder Chat cannot author these yet; build them against
Validate/Create directly. Read [Follow Graph](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/account-follows) before
using these sources.

**Supported operators:** `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `crosses_above`, `crosses_below`

  "actions": [{ "stepId": "step_1", "type": "webhook", "params": { "url": "https://your-runner.example/auto/events" } }],
  "expiresIn": "48h"
}
```

**13) Recurring trigger (`repeat`):**

Re-fire on the plan's own condition instead of a fixed cron cadence — notify every time BTC
crosses down through 60k, rate-limited to once per hour, capped at 10 fires. Note the
safer-pattern choices: `crosses_below` (reacts to the crossing edge, not a value sitting
below the line) plus a `1h` cooldown and a low `maxTriggers` ceiling.

```json
{
  "title": "Notify when BTC crosses below 60k",
  "description": "Recurring risk alert: fire each time BTC price crosses down through 60000, no more than once per hour, up to 10 times.",
  "conditions": { "AND": [{ "source": "price", "method": "current", "args": { "symbol": "BTC", "exchange": "hyperliquid" }, "operator": "crosses_below", "value": 60000 }] },

  "expiresIn": "7d",
  "repeat": { "cooldown": "1h", "maxTriggers": 10 }
}
```

**14) Calendar schedule (`cron.schedule`):**

Run on a wall-clock schedule — every weekday at 09:00 New York time. Direct EQL/API path
only (Builder Chat support pending).

```json
{
  "title": "Weekday 9am NY: market open recap",
  "description": "Every weekday at 09:00 America/New_York, run an LLM market-open recap.",
  "conditions": { "AND": [{ "source": "cron", "method": "schedule", "args": { "expression": "0 9 * * 1-5", "timezone": "America/New_York" }, "operator": "==", "value": true }] },
  "actions": [{ "stepId": "step_1", "type": "llm", "params": { "action": "chat", "message": "Give a concise market-open recap for BTC/ETH/SOL and flag overnight risk shifts." } }],
  "expiresIn": "7d"
}
```

**15) Funding flip (`funding`):**

Fire when Binance BTC funding turns negative — shorts start paying longs (crowded-short
signal). Note the composite `SYMBOL:EXCHANGE` ticker and venue-comparable `annualized_rate`.

```json
{
  "title": "BTC funding flips negative",
  "description": "Shorts are now paying longs on Binance BTC — a crowded-short signal worth reviewing.",
  "conditions": { "AND": [{ "source": "funding", "method": "annualized_rate", "args": { "ticker": "BTC:BINANCE" }, "operator": "crosses_below", "value": 0 }] },
  "actions": [{ "stepId": "step_1", "type": "notify", "params": { "message": "BTC funding on Binance flipped negative" } }],
  "expiresIn": "7d"
}
```

**16) Liquidation cascade (`liquidation` + `repeat`):**

Fire each time ETH liquidations cross $500k in a 5-minute window. Windows decay to zero once
a cascade subsides, so with `repeat` this fires **once per cascade**.

```json
{
  "title": "ETH liquidation cascade (5m > $500k)",
  "description": "Alert on each distinct ETH liquidation cascade on Bybit, capped at 10 alerts.",
  "conditions": { "AND": [{ "source": "liquidation", "method": "total_usd_5m", "args": { "ticker": "ETH:BYBIT" }, "operator": "crosses_above", "value": 500000 }] },
  "actions": [{ "stepId": "step_1", "type": "webhook", "params": { "url": "https://your-runner.example/auto/events" } }],
  "expiresIn": "7d",
  "repeat": { "cooldown": "1h", "maxTriggers": 10 }
}
```

**17) Catalyst → equity/index alert (HIP-3):**

The prediction-market-to-perp bridge: when a Fed-decision market reprices, alert your runner
on the S&P perp — including overnight and at weekends, when cash equities are closed.
`xyz:SP500` is a HIP-3 market on Hyperliquid. Resolve a real open Kalshi ticker first — don't
guess.

```json
{
  "title": "Fed cut odds → S&P alert",
  "description": "When the market prices a cut as more likely than not, notify my runner to review the S&P perp.",
  "conditions": { "AND": [{ "source": "kalshi", "method": "yes_price", "args": { "ticker": "<an open Kalshi Fed-decision market ticker>" }, "operator": "crosses_above", "value": 0.6 }] },
  "actions": [{ "stepId": "step_1", "type": "webhook", "params": { "url": "https://your-runner.example/auto/events" } }],
  "expiresIn": "168h",
  "repeat": { "cooldown": "4h", "maxTriggers": 3 }
}
```

#### Poll response shape

> **All query and execution identifiers are UUIDs** (e.g.
> `a12d20ff-6cb2-433e-afed-cc2e6a0380b6`) — **not** prefixed strings like `q_123` or
> `exec_123`. The short `q_123` forms used elsewhere in this skill are placeholders for
> readability only; never construct or pattern-match on a prefixed ID.

`GET /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}` (and the x402 `POST` equivalent) returns `queryId`, `status`,
an optional `credits`, `latestEvaluation` (current state), and `executions` (what actually
fired).

**Distinguish the two runtime surfaces — this is the most common polling mistake:**

| Surface | Answers | Read for the value |
|---|---|---|
| `latestEvaluation.conditionStates[]` | "what is true **right now**" | `currentValue` vs `targetValue` |
| Auto Trigger Context on an execution | "what **fired**, and why" | `trigger.matchedConditions[].match.observedValue` |

**`latestEvaluation`** is `null` until the query has evaluated at least once:

```json
{
  "evaluatedAt": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "conditionStates": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "source": "price",
      "method": "current",
      "args": { "symbol": "BTC" },
      "currentValue": 97250.5,
      "targetValue": 100000,
      "operator": "<",
      "isMet": true,
      "lastUpdated": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z"
    }
  ],
  "wouldTriggerNow": true,
  "matchingConditions": 1,
  "totalConditions": 1
}
```

`conditionStates[]` entries may also carry `reason`, and for `llm` conditions
`conversationSessionId`, `runId`, and `cacheHit`. Use `matchingConditions` / `totalConditions`
to show partial progress ("2 of 3 conditions met") without re-deriving it yourself.

**Auto Trigger Context** appears on execution records once the query has fired. It is the
**stable public representation of why the query fired** — raw stored trigger payloads are not
part of the public API, so do not depend on them.

```json
{
  "id": "a12d20ff-6cb2-433e-afed-cc2e6a0380b6",
  "queryId": "76e2e824-fc47-4d60-99b1-c227fbd2d3f5",
  "type": "notification",
  "status": "success",
  "details": { "notification": { "channel": "webhook" } },
  "triggerTime": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "conditionsMet": 1,
  "trigger": {
    "type": "price",
    "time": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "matchedConditions": [
      {
        "condition": {
          "source": "price",
          "method": "current",
          "args": { "symbol": "BTC" },
          "operator": "<",
          "value": 100000
        },
        "match": { "observedValue": 97250.5 }
      }
    ]
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-04-01T12:00:01.000Z"
}
```

- `trigger.matchedConditions[].condition.value` is the **threshold**;
  `.match.observedValue` is the **value seen at trigger time**. Report both when explaining a
  fire to a user.
- For Signal sources (`tweet` / `news`), `match` also carries provenance — `url`,
  `mentionedAt`, `confidence`, `accountHandle`, and for Telegram `chatUsername`, `chatTitle`,
  `messageId` / `messageIds`, `groupId`. Use `url` to link the user straight to the post that
  fired the plan.
- `details` is keyed by action kind (`trade`, `notification`, `llm`, `auto`, `script`).
- Failed executions carry `error` `{ code, message }`, e.g.
  `LLM_ACTION_UPSTREAM_ERROR`.

Auto Trigger Context is also included in outbound delivery payloads and script trigger
context — so a webhook receiver can explain a fire without a follow-up poll.

Use polling for debugging or backfills. For production delivery, prefer webhook or SSE
notifications. Store `sessionId` values from executions so you can fetch full LLM analysis
only when needed via `GET /v2/auto/queries/:queryId/sessions/:sessionId`.

#### Notifications — delivery channels

After a query triggers, Auto delivers events via one of three channels:

| Channel | Best for | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Webhook** | Production agent automation | `action.type = "webhook"` with signature verification + queue/worker |
| **Telegram** | Fast human-readable alerts | `action.type = "telegram_bot"` with `params.botToken` + `params.chatId` (direct), or webhook→bot relay for custom formatting |
| **SSE Stream** | Real-time event consumers; **always available regardless of the chosen action** | Two streams, both free and `GET`, both using the **same auth as query creation**: `GET /v2/auto/queries/stream` (account-wide — every query on one connection, **default**, API-key only) or `GET /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/stream` (single query; the x402 / agent-identity option). See [SSE frame format](#sse-frame-format). |

**Query `title` and `description` in notifications:** both fields are embedded in every
outbound notification (Telegram, webhook, SSE). Recipients often see an alert hours or days
after the query was set up — these fields are what make it clear **what** fired and **why
it was set up**. Always set them.

#### Notification payload (what Auto actually sends)

Auto's outbound **webhook** notification object has this shape:

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "type": "athena_query_notify_only",
  "category": "alerts",
  "title": "BTC breakout above 100k",
  "body": "price > threshold",
  "data": { "queryId": "q_123" },
  "priority": "high",
  "createdAt": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

`id` is the numeric notification ID; correlate back to a query via `data.queryId`. `title`
and `body` come from the query's `title` / `description` plus trigger context. **SSE delivery
uses a different, more compact frame** — see [SSE frame format](#sse-frame-format) below.

#### Canonical event payload contract (internal normalization)

It's useful to normalize incoming events (webhook, Telegram relay, SSE) to a single internal
shape so downstream processing is channel-agnostic. This is a **recommended runner-side
convention**, not the wire format Auto sends (see the payload above):

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "eventType": "query.triggered",
  "eventId": "evt_01J...",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "queryId": "q_123",
  "channel": "webhook",
  "trigger": {
    "symbol": "BTC",
    "reason": "price > threshold"
  },
  "evaluation": { "triggered": true },
  "action": { "type": "webhook" }
}
```

**Webhook request headers** (what your receiver must read):

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `X-Auto-Event-Id` | Unique event ID for deduplication |
| `X-Auto-Signature-Timestamp` | Unix seconds for replay-window check |
| `X-Auto-Signature` | `v1=<hex_hmac_sha256>` — verify against raw body |

#### SSE frame format

There are two SSE streams; both are **free**, both are `GET`, and both
use the **same auth used to create the query** (`x-elfa-api-key` for API-key queries, the x402
secret for x402 queries — *not* limited to `x-elfa-api-key`). For minimal setup, attach a
`notify` action with a `message` — those notifications are retrievable only via SSE or poll.

| Endpoint | Scope | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v2/auto/queries/stream` | Every query you own, on one connection | **Default.** Correlate events by the payload's `queryId`. **API-key only** — agent identities (`x-elfa-agent-secret`) and x402 get `403`. |
| `GET /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}/stream` | A single query | You only care about one query, or you are on x402 / an agent identity. |

Prefer the account-wide stream over one connection per query. Open it **after** creating at
least one query — it returns `410` when you have none.

Both streams emit the same frames — `event: notification`, `id` = the **notification outbox
event UUID** (not a query ID), and a `: keep-alive` comment every 15s. Events are
**live-only**: there is no replay and `Last-Event-ID` is ignored.

```
id: 9df34377-4d82-4b3c-a016-b0ba27556aa1
event: notification
data: {"status":"triggered","title":"Plan Triggered","body":"BTC RSI Breakout","queryId":"q_123","executionId":"2dbf0d70-a85f-4f67-9bd3-876e8fd89f86","triggerTime":"2026-04-01T12:00:00.000Z","conditionsMet":2,"timestamp":1774328400000}
```

`status` is one of `triggered`, `stopped`, `ended`, or `update`. `queryId` is a **top-level**
field on the payload — use it to correlate with poll results via `/v2/auto/queries/{queryId}`.
The payload also carries execution context when present (`executionId`, `triggerTime`,
`conditionsMet`, `autoDetails`).

**Stream lifecycle.** Each stream closes once there is nothing left to deliver, emitting a
final `end` event:

| | `/queries/stream` | `/queries/{queryId}/stream` |
|---|---|---|
| `410` on connect | You have no active queries | The query is already terminal and drained |
| Closes when | No active query and no pending execution, held 30s | The query reaches a terminal state and its notifications drain |
| Final frame | `data: {"code":"USER_STREAM_CLOSED"}` | `data: {"code":"QUERY_STREAM_CLOSED","status":"<terminalStatus>","queryId":"<uuid>"}` |

A `recurring` (`repeat`) query is never terminal, so its stream stays open across triggers. If
a stream fails after it has started, it emits `event: error` with `{"code":"STREAM_UNAVAILABLE"}`.

**Telegram relay job format** (when transforming webhook → Telegram Bot API):

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_01J...",
  "queryId": "q_123",
  "channel": "telegram",
  "chatId": "<CHAT_ID>",
  "text": "BTC trigger fired: price > threshold",
  "priority": "high"
}
```

#### Webhook signature verification

**Set an explicit `signingSecret` on every production webhook.** It is a `webhook` action
param, write-only — Elfa stores it for delivery signing and never returns it in query,
execution, webhook, SSE, or LLM-callback payloads. **Without it, signature headers may be
absent entirely** depending on access mode and server configuration, so a receiver that
requires signatures will reject every delivery.

```json
{
  "stepId": "step_1",
  "type": "webhook",
  "params": {
    "url": "https://your-runner.example/auto/events",
    "signingSecret": "<openssl rand -hex 32>",
    "allNotifications": true
  }
}
```

LLM callback webhooks take the same destination params under `params.callback.action.params`.

**Which secret to use — two distinct secrets, never interchange them:**

| Secret | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `x-elfa-api-key` | you → Elfa | Authenticates your client |
| `webhook.params.signingSecret` | Elfa → you | Signs Elfa's outbound webhook *deliveries* to your server |

Generate a separate high-entropy secret per webhook action (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Do **not**
reuse the API key or the x402 agent secret here.

Signing inputs:

```
expected = HMAC_SHA256(signingSecret, timestamp + "." + eventId + "." + rawBody)
```

> **The `signingSecret` is the HMAC key directly — do not hash it first.** Earlier revisions
> of this skill documented `HMAC_SHA256(SHA256(secret), ...)`. That is wrong for explicit
> signing secrets and will fail verification.
>
> **Legacy x402/agent fallback:** if an x402/agent webhook omits `signingSecret`, older
> deliveries may be signed with `SHA256(x-elfa-agent-secret)` as the key. Treat that as a
> legacy fallback, not a supported setup — set an explicit `signingSecret` instead.

**Node.js verification:**

```typescript
import crypto from "crypto";

export function verifyAutoWebhook(
  signingSecret: string,
  rawBody: string,
  signatureHeader: string,
  timestamp: string,
  eventId: string,
): boolean {
  if (!signatureHeader?.startsWith("v1=")) return false;
  const givenHex = signatureHeader.slice(3);
  if (!/^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i.test(givenHex)) return false;

  const payload = `${timestamp}.${eventId}.${rawBody}`;
  const expectedHex = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", signingSecret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest("hex");

  const given = Buffer.from(givenHex, "hex");
  const expected = Buffer.from(expectedHex, "hex");
  if (given.length !== expected.length) return false;
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(given, expected);
}
```

Operational checklist:
- Enforce a bounded replay window on `X-Auto-Signature-Timestamp` (reject drift >30s).
- Deduplicate by `X-Auto-Event-Id` in durable storage.
- Return `2xx` fast, then process asynchronously (queue + worker).

#### Telegram bot setup (for `action.type: "telegram_bot"` or relay)

1. Open `@BotFather` in Telegram → `/newbot` → save bot token (treat as secret).
2. Send any message to the bot (or in a group where the bot is present).
3. `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates"` → read `message.chat.id`.
4. Send messages via:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/sendMessage" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"chat_id": "<CHAT_ID>", "text": "Auto trigger fired for BTC RSI"}'
```

**Direct chats, groups, and supergroups:** `telegram_bot` delivers to private chats, groups,
and supergroups. **Channels are not supported** and are rejected at create time. Two gotchas
for groups: (1) **group chat IDs are negative** (`-1001234567890`) — copy verbatim from
`getUpdates`, including the leading `-`; (2) **the bot must be able to post** — at create time
Auto checks the bot's membership/permissions, and if it can't post, create fails with
`Telegram bot cannot send messages in this chat (check its permissions)`. If a group is later
upgraded to a supergroup (new chat ID), Auto detects the migration, updates the stored ID, and
retries — no action needed.

#### Agent runner — reference architecture

Auto handles query evaluation + event emission. Your runner handles event ingestion,
verification, deduplication, strategy continuation, and audit logging.

```
Auto Query
  → Auto Event Ingress (Webhook / SSE)
  → Signature Verification + Idempotency
  → Job Queue
  → Agent Decision Worker
  → Action Adapter (Telegram / Internal API / Order Router)
  → Logs + Metrics + Alerts
```

**Core processing loop:**

1. Receive event (webhook or SSE frame).
2. Verify signature (webhook only).
3. Check idempotency — is `eventId` already processed?
4. Enqueue job and ACK `2xx` fast.
5. Worker resolves extra context (poll query, fetch LLM session).
6. Apply policy, decide next step.
7. Execute downstream action.
8. Record result for replay/debug.

**Instruction envelope** — structured contract passed from ingress to worker:

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_123",
  "queryId": "q_123",
  "objective": "Handle trigger and decide next action",
  "allowedActions": ["notify", "fetch_session", "execute_adapter"],
  "constraints": {
    "maxExecutionSeconds": 30,
    "riskMode": "conservative"
  }
}
```

**Minimal TypeScript worker skeleton:**

```typescript
type AutoJob = { eventId: string; queryId: string; raw: unknown };
const queue: AutoJob[] = [];
const processed = new Set<string>();

function onWebhook(eventId: string, queryId: string, raw: unknown) {
  if (processed.has(eventId)) return; // idempotent
  queue.push({ eventId, queryId, raw });
}

async function workerLoop() {
  while (true) {
    const job = queue.shift();
    if (!job) { await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 250)); continue; }
    // 1) Pull latest query/execution state if needed
    // 2) Fetch session details for llm actions
    // 3) Decide next action (policy + agent logic)
    // 4) Execute action (notify, relay, order adapter)
    processed.add(job.eventId);
  }
}
```

**Deployment patterns:**

| Pattern | Best for |
|---|---|
| Single process (API + worker) | Early-stage prototypes |
| API + queue + workers | Production reliability at scale |
| Serverless consumer + queue worker | Spiky workloads with managed ops |

**Local (Docker Compose) stack:**

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  redis: { image: redis:7-alpine, ports: ["6379:6379"] }
  ingress:
    build: ./ingress
    environment:
      AUTO_SECRET: ${AUTO_SECRET}
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379
    depends_on: [redis]
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
  worker:
    build: ./worker
    environment:
      AUTO_SECRET: ${AUTO_SECRET}
      REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379
      ELFA_BASE_URL: https://api.elfa.ai/v2/auto
    depends_on: [redis]
```

**Minimal environment contract** (same keys local + cloud):

```
AUTO_SECRET=<event-signing secret>
ELFA_BASE_URL=https://api.elfa.ai/v2/auto
QUEUE_URL=<redis/sqs/pubsub endpoint>
RUNNER_MODE=local|cloud
```

**Reliability checklist:**

- Store dedupe keys by `eventId` in durable storage
- Retry policy with dead-letter queue
- Keep webhook handler fast and non-blocking
- Log decision input/output for every run
- Health checks + alerting on worker lag

**Recommended setup by stage:**

| Stage | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Prototype | Auto Telegram + local worker |
| Production | Auto webhook + queue + worker |
| Real-time operations | Auto SSE + worker service |

#### Notification troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `400` / `401` when polling or streaming | Missing/invalid API key or auth headers | Send `x-elfa-api-key` |
| Webhook signature mismatch | Signing wrong payload (not raw body), or hashing the secret before use | Key is the **raw** `signingSecret`, payload is `timestamp + "." + eventId + "." + rawBody`. Do not use `SHA256(secret)` as the key |
| No signature headers on webhook deliveries | No explicit `signingSecret` set on the webhook action | Set `params.signingSecret` and recreate the query |
| Duplicate downstream actions | No idempotency on event processing | Dedupe by `eventId` before enqueue/execute |
| Event received but agent does nothing | Ingress processes inline and times out | ACK fast, push to queue, process in worker |
| SSE disconnect/reconnect loops | No retry/backoff or unstable consumer | Add reconnect backoff + heartbeat monitoring |
| Missing triggers after some time | Query expired or was cancelled | Poll status; check `expiresIn`, `status`, `latestEvaluation` |
| "Why hasn't it fired yet?" | Condition is close but not met | Read `latestEvaluation.conditionStates[]` — compare `currentValue` vs `targetValue`, and `matchingConditions` vs `totalConditions`. Do **not** infer this from executions |
| "Why did it fire?" | Need the value at trigger time, not the current value | Read the execution's `trigger.matchedConditions[]` — `.match.observedValue` vs `.condition.value`. `latestEvaluation` has since moved on |
| Signature timestamp rejected | Runner clock skew | Sync clock (NTP); enforce bounded replay window |
| `Telegram bot cannot send messages in this chat` at create | Bot isn't in the group, or the group revokes `can_send_messages` for it | Add the bot to the chat and grant send permission (or make it an admin), then retry |
| Telegram create fails for a group | `chatId` missing the leading `-`, or the target is a channel | Group IDs are negative (`-1001234567890`); channels are not supported |

#### Validation errors — next action table

When `/v2/auto/queries/validate` (or Create) rejects, the error is almost always a phrasing
issue, not a capability gap. Iterate on Validate instead of abandoning the query.

| Error signal | What it means | Next action |
|---|---|---|
| `EQL_MISSING_ARG` | A required arg is absent (e.g. `period` on `ema`/`sma`, or `exchange` on any `price`/`ta` condition) | Add the missing arg from the TA Args Contract, re-validate |
| Missing/invalid `exchange` on `price`/`ta` | Every `price`/`ta` condition needs `exchange` | Add `exchange` (`hyperliquid`, `gmx`, or `binance`) to the condition `args`, re-validate |
| `EQL_INVALID_ARG` / type errors | Wrong type (`"14"` instead of `14`) or unrecognized key (`length` vs `period`) | Use exact key names + JSON numeric types |
| Unknown `method` | Indicator name not supported | Pick nearest supported method; ask Builder Chat to substitute |
| Unsupported `timeframe` / `period` | Value outside enum | Snap to nearest allowed value |
| Unsupported `symbol` / source | Asset not indexed or DEX pair unsupported | Skip symbol and report it; proceed with supported subset |
| Depth / leaf-count exceeded | More than depth 3 or 10 leaves | Split into two queries joined by your runner |
| `cron` / `llm` period too short | Below 1h minimum | Raise to `1h` or higher |
| Unmonitored `tweet` username | `tweet.semantic` `args.username` not in monitored active accounts | Replace with a monitored active handle (without `@`) and re-validate |
| Invalid `minConfidence` (`tweet` / `telegram` / `news`) | Non-integer or outside `0..100` | Use a JSON integer between `0` and `100` (start with `80`) |
| Unresolved `telegram` channel | `chatUsername` / `chatId` does not resolve to a monitored public channel, or shorthand carried both identifiers | Use one identifier on shorthand, drop `@` and `t.me/`, and pick a monitored public channel |
| Invalid `sec` CIK | `args.ticker` is not 1–10 digits, or the CIK is absent from SEC submissions metadata | Pass the issuer CIK (not the stock ticker) and re-validate |
| `EQL_INVALID_ACTION` | The query or draft uses `market_order` / `limit_order`, at top level or in an `llm` callback | Replace with `webhook`, `notify`, `telegram_bot` or `llm`, and run execution from your own runner |
| `kalshi` ticker not open (`EQL_INVALID_ARG_VALUE` on `args.ticker`) | Ticker is not a currently-open Kalshi market (closed/settled/unknown) | Resolve a currently-open full ticker and re-validate; don't guess tickers |
| `kalshi` invalid enum / operator | Enum `value` outside its set, or operator not in the method's allowlist (e.g. `crosses_above` on `trade_size`) | Use the per-method operator allowlists and enum sets from the `kalshi` source reference |
| `kalshi` `is_block_trade` type error | `value` passed as a string instead of a JSON boolean | Use JSON `true` / `false`, not `"true"` / `"false"` |
| `polymarket` ticker not found / not active | `args.ticker` is not a live Polymarket outcome token (`asset_id`) — unknown or inactive | Resolve a currently-active outcome-token `asset_id` and re-validate; don't guess ids |
| `polymarket` invalid operator / dynamic value | Operator not in the method's allowlist (e.g. `crosses_above` on `size`, `>` on `side`), or a dynamic (field-vs-field) `value` was used | Use the per-method operator allowlists; use a literal `value` (dynamic values are unsupported for `polymarket`) |
| `cron.schedule` cadence too fast | Minute field isn't a single fixed value (e.g. `*/15 * * * *`), or a sub-hour cadence | Use a single fixed minute — see the `cron.schedule` allowed/not-allowed examples |
| `EQL_INVALID_REPEAT` | `repeat` was combined with a recurring cron condition (`cron.every` / `cron.schedule`) — both provide recurrence | Remove `repeat` for recurring cron (cron already recurs), or drop the cron condition |
| `EQL_INVALID_ARG_VALUE` with `details.hip3: true` | A HIP-3 (dex-prefixed) symbol was used on a `funding` / `liquidation` condition — those feeds don't publish HIP-3 keys | Use a plain base symbol (`BTC:BINANCE`). HIP-3 stays valid on `price`/`ta` |
| Unknown symbol in a composite ticker | Symbol not listed on that venue's perp catalog (often a naming mismatch) | Check the venue's own base-symbol convention (`1000PEPE` on Binance/Bybit vs `KPEPE` on Hyperliquid) |
| `SYMBOL_CATALOG_UNAVAILABLE` (HTTP `503`) | Market catalog was momentarily unreachable, so the symbol couldn't be checked — validation fails closed | Retry after the interval in the `Retry-After` header; this is transient — do not reshape the query |
| Dynamic value in action params | Dynamic values only allowed in condition `value` | Move dynamic reference into condition; keep action params literal |

Cross-operator semantics: `crosses_above` = previous `<` threshold AND current `>=` threshold.
`crosses_below` = previous `>` threshold AND current `<=` threshold. Both require previous-state
tracking server-side.

#### Substitution ladder — if Auto doesn't fit

Before concluding a use case is out of scope, walk this ladder. Most intents resolve at
rung 1 or 2.

1. **Rephrase through Builder Chat** — append `"If anything is unsupported, return the closest supported query and list substitutions"` to your chat prompt.
2. **Iterate on Validate Query** — loop: validate → reshape → re-validate. Do NOT jump to "this isn't possible" after one rejection.
3. **Split into multiple queries** joined by your runner (for depth 3 / 10-leaf limits).
4. **Use `source: "llm"`** with `athena_condition` for fuzzy/narrative predicates.
5. **Pre-compute in your own service, use Auto as control plane** — only after rungs 1–4 fail.

**Worked example — "alert on descending trendline break":**

- **Rung 1:** Rephrase as a supported proxy — _"alert when BTC price crosses above 4h upper Bollinger Band AND 1h RSI > 55"_.
- **Rung 4:** If the proxy isn't acceptable, use `source: "llm"` with a scheduled natural-language predicate — _"has BTC broken its recent descending trendline on the 4h chart?"_.
- **Rung 5:** Only if both fail: compute trendline-break externally, feed a boolean into an Auto `cron` + `llm` query as the condition trigger.

Do not build your own monitoring/evaluation/trigger stack before walking rungs 1–4.

#### Query drafts

Drafts let you stage an Auto query without activating it (and without spending credits).
Useful for human-in-the-loop approval workflows, dashboards where users edit before
committing, or batch authoring flows.

**Draft lifecycle:**

1. `POST /v2/auto/queries/drafts` — create or update a draft (idempotent upsert).
2. `GET /v2/auto/queries/drafts` — list editable drafts.
3. `POST /v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId/validate` — validate stored draft.
4. `POST /v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId/convert` — promote draft → active query.
5. `DELETE /v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId` — discard draft.

> `GET /v2/auto/queries/drafts/:draftId` still works but is legacy — prefer
> `GET /v2/auto/queries/{queryId}` which resolves both active queries and drafts.

Drafts are API-key-mode only. Not available via x402.

#### Symbols

Auto is **not crypto-only.** Crypto majors and on-chain tokens are plain uppercase tickers
(`BTC`, `ETH`, `SOL`, `HYPE`, long-tail tokens). **HIP-3 assets** on Hyperliquid — tokenized
equities, indices, commodities, FX, and pre-IPO names — use a **DEX-prefixed** form
`<dex>:<SYMBOL>` and trade **24/7**, even when the underlying cash market is closed.

**Two DEX prefixes matter in practice:** `xyz` lists nearly everything and carries almost all
the volume; `mkts` lists a smaller overlapping set. Hyperliquid hosts other HIP-3 DEXs whose
markets are **dormant** (listed but not trading) — Auto **rejects** them exactly like a typo
(`EQL_INVALID_SYMBOL`). A symbol being listed on Hyperliquid is **not** enough; only the
liquid listing is usable (`GOLD` appears on six DEXs). A **bare** HIP-3 symbol is rejected —
`{"symbol": "GOLD"}` fails with `EQL_INVALID_SYMBOL`. Only plain crypto tickers work without a
prefix (they live on Hyperliquid's main DEX).

| Class | Examples |
|---|---|
| Crypto majors | `BTC`, `ETH`, `SOL`, `HYPE` (no prefix — main DEX) |
| On-chain / long-tail tokens | `RAVE`, `TAO`, niche memes |
| Indices (HIP-3) | `xyz:SP500`, `xyz:XYZ100` (Nasdaq 100), `xyz:JP225`, `mkts:US500`, `mkts:USTECH` |
| Sector / country baskets (HIP-3) | `xyz:SMH` (semis), `xyz:XLE` (energy), `xyz:EWY`, `xyz:EWJ` |
| Equities — mega-cap (HIP-3) | `xyz:NVDA`, `xyz:TSLA`, `xyz:AAPL`, `xyz:MSFT`, `xyz:GOOGL`, `xyz:META` |
| Equities — semis / high-beta (HIP-3) | `xyz:AMD`, `xyz:TSM`, `xyz:ARM`, `xyz:COIN`, `xyz:MSTR`, `xyz:PLTR` |
| Pre-IPO / private (HIP-3) | `xyz:SPCX` (SpaceX), `xyz:ZHIPU`, `xyz:MINIMAX` |
| Commodities (HIP-3) | `xyz:CL` (WTI crude), `xyz:BRENTOIL`, `xyz:NATGAS`, `xyz:GOLD`, `xyz:SILVER`, `xyz:COPPER` |
| FX (HIP-3) | `xyz:EUR`, `xyz:JPY`, `xyz:GBP` |

**Illustrative, not exhaustive — and listings change.** Markets are added and go dormant.
Never hardcode this list: confirm any HIP-3 symbol with
`GET /v2/auto/validate-symbol/{exchange}/{symbol}` before building on it, and read a rejection
as "that market is dead", not "Auto is missing the asset". HIP-3 market data comes from
**`hyperliquid` only** — a HIP-3 symbol on `gmx` is rejected with `EQL_INVALID_SYMBOL`.

**Composite tickers (`funding` / `liquidation` only):** those two sources do **not** take a
`symbol` + `exchange` arg — they take a single `SYMBOL:EXCHANGE` ticker (e.g. `BTC:BINANCE`,
`ETH:HYPERLIQUID`, `SOL:BYBIT`). Use each venue's own base-symbol convention: `1000PEPE` on
Binance/Bybit vs `KPEPE` on Hyperliquid. HIP-3 symbols are rejected for these two sources.

**Tracking coverage:** conditions, alerts and webhooks cover DEX/on-chain assets —
effectively unbounded (long-tail tokens, pre-CEX-listing assets, niche memes). Symbol
support is per venue, so pre-flight anything unusual with
`GET /v2/auto/validate-symbol/{exchange}/{symbol}` (which checks `hyperliquid` or `binance`)
before building a `price`/`ta` condition
on it. If a symbol is unsupported on the venue you picked, switch venue or symbol — or keep
the condition on a supported pair and route follow-up work through `notify`, `webhook` or
`telegram_bot`.

[Catalyst Triggers](https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/catalyst-triggers).

#### Executions

Every trigger fire produces an **execution record** — use these endpoints to audit trigger
history, debug failed actions, or reconcile with your runner's audit log.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/v2/auto/executions` | GET | List execution records (filterable) |
| `/v2/auto/executions/:executionId` | GET | Get a single execution record |

Execution records are also embedded in the poll response (`GET /v2/auto/queries/:queryId`)
under the `executions` array, but the dedicated endpoints are useful for cross-query audits
and pagination.

Executions are API-key-mode only. Not available via x402.

### Step 4: Generating code snippets

When the user wants integration help, generate correct, production-ready code.
See the [Elfa API documentation](https://docs.elfa.ai) for the full parameter specs.

**Principles for code generation:**
- Always mention both access modes (API key and x402) so developers know their options
- Include the signup link `https://go.elfa.ai/claude-skills` as a comment near the
  API key placeholder, and link to `https://docs.elfa.ai/x402-payments` for x402
- Always include proper error handling
- For API key mode: show the `x-elfa-api-key` header (use a placeholder like `YOUR_API_KEY`)
- For x402 mode: show the `/x402/v2/` prefix and recommend `@x402/fetch` or `@x402/axios`
- For Auto mutations in x402 mode: include the agent-secret header
- Include TypeScript types when generating TS code
- Add comments explaining each parameter
- For pagination endpoints, show how to paginate through results
- For time-windowed endpoints, explain the `timeWindow` vs `from`/`to` pattern

**Language priorities** (use unless the user specifies otherwise):
1. TypeScript/JavaScript (fetch) — most Elfa integrators are web/Node devs
2. Python (requests)
3. curl

**The Chat endpoint deserves special attention** — it's the most complex:
- It supports multiple `analysisType` values: `chat`, `macro`, `summary`, `tokenIntro`,
  `tokenAnalysis`, `accountAnalysis`
- Session management via `sessionId` for multi-turn conversations
- Different `assetMetadata` requirements per analysis type (`message` is required only for
  `analysisType: "chat"`)
- Three speed modes: `fast`, `expert` (default), and `adaptive` (`/v2/chat` only)
- Two transports: `POST /v2/chat` (JSON) and `POST /v2/chat/stream` (SSE, PAYG/Enterprise) —
  same body, different plan gate. See [Step 2c](#chat--json-vs-streaming) for the SSE event
  types.

**Auto code generation guidance:**
- Always include the validate → create flow (never create without validating first)
- For API key mode: send `x-elfa-api-key` on every call, including mutations
- For x402 mode: include `x-elfa-agent-secret` header on all query lifecycle calls
- Include Builder Chat examples when the user wants natural-language query building
- Show how to poll or stream for results after query creation

### Common patterns

**Time window parameters:**
Many endpoints accept either `timeWindow` (e.g., "30m", "1h", "4h", "24h", "7d", "30d")
OR `from`/`to` unix timestamps. If both are provided, `from`/`to` takes priority.

**Pagination:**
Aggregation endpoints (trending-tokens, trending-cas, top-mentions, token-news) use
`page` + `pageSize`. The keyword-mentions endpoint uses cursor-based pagination instead
(`cursor` + `limit`).

**Defaults differ per endpoint — do not assume a global default.** From the current spec:

| Endpoint | `timeWindow` | `page` | `pageSize` / `limit` | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `trending-tokens` | `7d` | `1` | `50` | `minMentions` (default `5`) |
| `trending-cas/twitter` · `trending-cas/telegram` | `7d` | `1` | `50` | `minMentions` (default `5`) |
| `top-mentions` | `1h` | `1` | `10` | `ticker` **required**, `reposts` |
| `token-news` | `7d` | `1` | `20` | `coinIds`, `reposts` |
| `keyword-mentions` | `7d` | — (cursor) | `limit` `20`, **max 30** | `keywords`, `accountName`, `searchType`, `cursor`, `reposts` |
| `event-summary` | `7d` | — | — | `keywords` **required**, `searchType` (default `or`) |
| `trending-narratives` | — | — | — | `timeFrame` (`day` \| `week`, default `day`), `maxNarratives` (default `7`, range `1`–`20`), `maxTweetsPerNarrative` (default `5`, range `1`–`20`) |
| `smart-stats` | — | — | — | `username` **required** |

Every endpoint above except `trending-narratives` and `smart-stats` also accepts `from`/`to`
unix timestamps, which take priority over `timeWindow`.

**Per-endpoint parameter notes:**
- **`keyword-mentions`** — provide either `keywords` (up to 5, comma-separated) OR
  `accountName` (or both); `accountName` filters mentions by a specific account (e.g.
  `accountName=elonmusk`). `searchType` accepts **`and`** (all terms must be present) or
  **`or`** (any term matches). Cursor-paginated — pass `metadata.cursor` from the previous
  response as `cursor`. Returns `account.username`, which feeds directly into `smart-stats`.
- **`event-summary`** — `keywords` is **required**; `searchType` defaults to `or`. A `503`
  means the upstream model declined to process the matched posts — retryable, and **not** an
  empty result. The 4 fixed credits are not charged; the 1 base per-request credit still is.
- **`token-news`** — V2 always returns news mentions (no `isNews` parameter). Results are X
  posts from accounts tagged as news sources, not articles published by news outlets.
- **`top-mentions`** — `ticker` is **required**. Account details are always included (no
  `includeAccountDetails` parameter).
- **`smart-stats`** — the query param is `username`, not `accountName`.
- **`minMentions`** (trending-tokens / trending-cas) — floor on mention count; raise it to cut
  long-tail noise.
- **`reposts`** (keyword-mentions / top-mentions / token-news) — boolean toggle for including
  repost activity.

**Ticker format (top-mentions):**
The `ticker` parameter behavior changes based on whether you include the `$` prefix:
- **With `$` prefix** (e.g., `ticker=$SOL` or URL-encoded `ticker=%24SOL`): Exact cashtag matching only. Searches the `cashtags` field for exact matches.
- **Without `$` prefix** (e.g., `ticker=SOL`): Broader search across both cashtags (boosted 2x) and general token references.

Use `$` when you want only cashtag-specific mentions. Omit `$` for a more inclusive search.

**Credit costs (data endpoints — both modes):**
- Most endpoints: 1 credit per call ($0.0145 via x402)
- Event summary: 5 credits ($0.0725 via x402)
- Trending narratives: 5 credits ($0.0725 via x402)
- Chat: speed-based; via x402 pay `exact` (fast $1, expert $2) or `upto` (fast $2, expert $6)
- `/v2/ping`, `/v2/key-status`: free
- Every `/v2/*` response to an authenticated request carries an **`x-elfa-credits`** header with
  the credits that request consumed — read it instead of diffing `/v2/key-status` around a call.
  It is present on error responses raised after the key is accepted, and absent when the request
  is rejected before the key resolves, because nothing was charged. Streaming responses and
  charges that finalize after the response is flushed carry the pre-flush subtotal, so
  `/v2/key-status` stays the authoritative balance for those.

**Auto query lifecycle:**
- **Validate before create (recommended):** Call `POST /v2/auto/queries/validate` first to preview
  estimated credits and catch validation errors before committing. The server validates internally
  during create anyway, but pre-validation lets you iterate on errors without side effects.
- Prefer webhook or SSE for real-time delivery
- Deduplicate events by `eventId`
- Use shorter expiries (`24h`–`3d`) for fresh signals
- Include `title` and `description` in queries — they appear in notifications

## Important notes

- The Elfa API domain (`api.elfa.ai`) must be accessible from the network. If blocked,
  inform the user and provide the code snippet instead.
- Always use the v2 endpoints (paths starting with `/v2/` or `/x402/v2/`).
- For experimental endpoints (trending-tokens), mention that behavior may
  change without notice. `/v2/account/smart-stats` is **legacy**: it still works, but
  **will be removed on 28 October 2026** — say so before building on it.
  `/v2/data/market-events` is **Enterprise only** — a key without access gets `403`.
- Measurement endpoints return **no raw tweet text and no sentiment field** — do not promise
  either. Fetching post content requires the user's own X API key.
- Auto no longer accepts order actions (`market_order` / `limit_order`) on new queries or
  drafts — Athena rejects them with `EQL_INVALID_ACTION`. Trigger a `webhook`, `notify` or
  `telegram_bot` action and run execution from your own runner.
- When the user asks about pricing or API key tiers, direct them to
  https://go.elfa.ai/claude-skills for full details on plans and pricing.
- API-key request rate limits are per tier: Free / PAYG = **60 requests/min**,
  Grow = **120 requests/min** (Enterprise custom). These are independent of credit balances.
  A `429` response should be retried honoring `Retry-After`.
- x402 is currently in beta. Rate limits: 1,000 requests per 60s window (per client IP).
- Install/update this skill with `npx skills add elfa-ai/skills`. API keys come from the
  [Elfa Developer Portal](https://go.elfa.ai/dev).
- x402 and API key credits are independent — they do not overlap or share balances.
- For x402 documentation and setup, refer users to https://docs.elfa.ai/x402-payments.
- For Auto documentation, refer users to https://docs.elfa.ai/auto/overview.
- Auto x402 agent secret must be persistent — do not rotate per request.
- For the full list of Auto capabilities, triggers, and query templates, see
